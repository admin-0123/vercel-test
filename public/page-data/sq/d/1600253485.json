Today we have enough distance on the quotidian works of the era to consider them of historical and cultural significance. In fact, stylistic aspects of both high-style and mass-market design of the time are frequently reiterated in contemporary architecture, and period buildings have escalated substantially in value. </p>\n<p><strong>MIDCENTURY: A Series on Architecture, Landscape, Urbanism, and Design</strong> will consider manuscripts in architecturally related disciplines within the distinctive cultural context of their time.
