Marie Griffith’s <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5671\">Making the World Over: Confronting Racism, Misogyny, and Xenophobia in U.S. History</a></h6>\n<p><em>\"I really do feel like the work and time we spend avoiding having difficult conversations is so much more wasteful and painful and time-consuming than actually having the difficult conversation.\"</em><br>\n-Shonda Rimes</p>\n<p>Abortion, it isn’t said nearly often enough, is a singular experience for each person who has one, in large part because of how strongly we are individually conditioned to feel about it by religion and other social and cultural influences. It seems to me that the fear of telling the wrong person and getting an adverse reaction keeps most women silent about any personal experiences with abortion, a silence that (needless to say) has enormous political consequences. I believe it’s important not to judge others for their reproductive choices or the emotions that do or don’t accompany abortion; unfortunately, the dreadful condition of abortion debate in the U.S. is the result of ceaseless judgment and vilification in this area going back more than half a century.</p>\n<p>If the pollsters and other researchers are right, more often than not those favoring safe abortion access and those opposing it likewise hold views that are less rigidly fixed than can be captured by simple terms like “pro-life” or “pro-choice.” Most data suggest that Americans occupy many positions along the spectrum of views. This does not mean people are namby-pamby or indifferent when it comes to abortion: they stand on ethical precepts, they have conscience claims, and they cite constitutional rights that are deemed valid in our legal structure; yet they come out all over the place in terms of their outlooks. So how do we decide this fraught issue? Does one side’s moral principles win out completely over the other’s, or are there ways to adjudicate fairly between them? What principles can guide us when a fundamental assertion of a sizable minority of the U.S. population—that all abortion is murder—is not empirically verifiable or ethically certain and is not shared by the majority?</p>\n<p>1973’s <em>Roe v. Wade</em> decision instantly decriminalized abortion across the country. Since prior to that decision most Americans, including a majority of American Catholic laypeople, had supported some measure of abortion reform that would loosen the laws prohibiting it in nearly all cases, the initial reaction was fairly calm, even positive. Southern Baptist leaders praised the Roe decision in its immediate aftermath. But by the mid-1980s they and other conservative Protestants had dramatically reversed course and adopted the official Catholic view—completely new to most Protestants—that abortion was murder from the instant the egg and sperm joined in the womb. That the conservative Protestant position was Catholicized in this way went almost unremarked at the time, until to many it came to seem simply obvious that Christians writ large must oppose abortion. Liberal and progressive Protestants and Catholics had long supported abortion rights for the sake of poor women who so often risked death to procure illegal abortions, and they became closer allies of pro-choice organizations such as Planned Parenthood.</p>\n<p>Throughout its duration, the political war over abortion has been marked by the perception that the pro-life and pro-choice sides are arguing on wholly different terms, except in the paradoxical sense that each describes itself as protecting a vulnerable population from an intolerant faction of oppressors. Critics of abortion have claimed to be protecting the most vulnerable life on earth: in their eyes, these are unborn persons, fully human from the very earliest stage of pregnancy but unable to defend themselves; and believed capable, even as embryos, of severe distress and pain. Supporters of abortion rights have focused their protection claims on women, vulnerable to sexual coercion, violence, and countless modes of gender-based discrimination; and believed to have the full right to abort an embryo/fetus (not considered a “person” until some late stage in pregnancy, or even birth itself) whatever the circumstances that led to conception. Leaders and adherents of both movements claim to care deeply about the lives of both women and children, but their opponents often see them as fanatical, power-hungry charlatans.</p>\n<p>When it comes to abortion, we remain as deep in the throes of conflict as we have since 1973. Since then, much has changed. Over the decades, the costs of this conflict have been staggeringly high financially, and very, very grim. Already many abortion providers have had their lives and livelihoods threatened and even been murdered; already countless numbers of women have been harassed, sometimes viciously, on their way to exercise their legal right to a legal abortion. To those who believe that life itself begins at conception with the creation of a sacred being instantly as precious as any human living outside the womb and that abortion is murder from that instant, millions of lives are lost each year to abortion. One does not have to agree with this view of abortion in order to recognize the deep distress it causes people who genuinely believe it. To those who believe that grave injury is done to women who are compelled to carry unwanted pregnancies to full term, and who believe that if abortion were outlawed millions of women would once again seek out illegal abortions from which many would be harmed or killed, the lives of millions of women could be potentially lost each year to abortion. One does not have to agree with this view in order to recognize the deep distress it causes people who genuinely believe it. That’s where both truthfulness and empathy come in.</p>\n<p>What would courage entail? Perhaps it means that abortion supporters agree to consider as good a reduction in the abortion rate, rather than treating this as an unspeakable topic. They do, after all, want to reduce the rate of unwanted pregnancies, and presumably so do abortion opponents. Can this be done, in a collaborative effort between those who consider themselves pro-life and those who consider themselves pro-choice? And perhaps it also means that abortion opponents accept the good faith arguments of those who do not consider abortion murder and that they focus their efforts on ensuring that they themselves are not complicit with abortion services rather than trying to outlaw those for everyone else.

Escott on Black political organizations in the Civil War period. This is the final post in our three-part blog series for Juneteenth 2022. You can read Part I <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/news/a-note-on-juneteenth\">here</a> and Part II <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/news/before-juneteenth-celebrating-emancipation-at-smithfield-plantation\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>We can rejoice that June 19th is an official federal holiday, for until recently most white Americans had not heard of Juneteenth. The Associated Press tells readers that Juneteenth was “the effective end of slavery in the U.S.” and explains that on that date in 1865 “Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas,” a full “two months after the Confederacy surrendered in the Civil War and about 2 ½ year after the Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves in Southern states.” Juneteenth deserves to be remembered and observed.</p>\n<p>But it is important to recognize Juneteenth’s significance <em>fully and correctly</em>. Black people in Galveston, Texas were not the only slaves who had to wait for emancipation. Lincoln’s proclamation on January 1, 1863, had no practical benefit for the vast majority of slaves in the Confederacy, where owners tried to deny them even news of Lincoln’s proclamation. Not until the war ended could most slaves start to pry freedom from the grasp of resistant southern whites.</p>\n<p>It also is important to combat erroneous assumptions about what came next. What were the freed slaves ready to do? Northern abolitionists had argued that slavery brutally degraded enslaved men, women, and children and deprived them of education, morality, and competency.  Racists North and South insisted that African Americans were unfit for and incapable of self-government. Some readers today probably assume that slavery’s end meant that former slaves emerged, totally unprepared, into a world they did not, and could not, understand—a world in which they were incapable of acting as citizens and voters in a democracy.</p>\n<p><em>Black Suffrage: Lincoln’s Last Goal</em> documents how mistaken such assumptions would be. In 1865 (and before), Black Americans in every part of the nation, South as well as North, spoke out repeatedly and made a powerful case for their rights. Two hundred thousand Black soldiers had fought to save the Union. At war’s end, African Americans organized, wrote petitions, claimed the right of suffrage, and demonstrated their fitness for equal rights as citizens.</p>\n<p>In the North, the National Convention of Colored Men decided in 1864 to form the National Equal Rights League, with chapters in every state. From the beginning of 1865, assemblies of the League demanded the right to vote and appealed “to the minds and consciences of the American people” to recognize “our rights as American citizens.” Black people had sacrificed for the Union, and Black northerners documented their communities’ achievements “in morals, education, industry, wealth and religion” and called for “complete enfranchisement” and equal rights as citizens. In at least eleven state-wide conventions and assemblies during 1865 northern Black leaders petitioned lawmakers, issued addresses to the public, and demanded “equal political rights without distinction of race or color.”</p>\n<p>Equally impressive were the initiative, energy, and eloquence of southern Blacks. By August 1865 Black people had assembled in at least five cities of the upper South and held meetings in Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, and North Carolina to call for justice and the right to vote. Later that fall additional conventions met in Vicksburg, Charleston, and other southern cities. There they warned northern lawmakers that southern whites were planning a “practical re-enslavement” and were passing laws that would be “but another name for slavery.” The South Carolinians assured whites that they had “no hatred or malice,” appealed to Christian morality, and asked “only for <em>even-handed Justice.</em>” But they also rejected discrimination, called for “good schools,” and insisted that “we are not freemen till we attain to all the rights and privileges of freemen.”  North Carolina’s Blacks made similar moral appeals and spoke of their desire to live in harmony with whites.  Rather than rely on northern “troops,” they sought to prove their “industry, sobriety, and respectful demeanor” as citizens. But “oppressive laws” and “unjust discrimination” must be “wiped from the statutes of the State.”  The right to vote and equality before the law were essential parts of citizenship.</p>\n<p>Former slaves and the free Blacks of the North showed that they were knowledgeable about democracy and ready for freedom. Our understanding of Juneteenth should include these points, and we should remember that neither Juneteenth nor the adoption of the 13th Amendment brought an “effective end of slavery in the U.S.” Tragically, debt peonage, convict labor, disfranchisement, Jim Crow segregation, and persistent racism extended injustice through many later decades.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ready for Freedom","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"5793","Title":"Black Suffrage"}],"date":"2022-06-21"},"fields":{"slug":"/ready-for-freedom"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Juneteenth is our newest national holiday, and today it is celebrated by people of all races throughout the United States. This is the way it should be. Juneteenth should not be seen as a Black holiday; it is a national commemoration of the end of slavery in the United States. The institution of slavery had been deeply entrenched throughout the nation at its founding, and eliminating slavery took the bloodiest war in American history. As traumatic as that process was, however, the abolition of slavery in the United States was one of the great steps forward in our long effort to realize the ideals on which this nation was founded, and Juneteenth provides a national commemoration of that fact. It is a long-delayed and welcome addition to our national calendar.</p>\n<p>Until recently, though, June 19 was just one of several dates on which African Americans celebrated the end of slavery. And it wasn’t even the most well-known or the most widespread of those dates. Juneteenth grew out of the unique circumstances surrounding emancipation in Texas, and for many years it was confined almost exclusively to the African American community in that state. At Smithfield plantation (the site where Virginia Tech is located now), slavery ended very differently than it did in Texas, so freedpeople there and their descendants marked its end very differently.</p>\n<p>Smithfield lay in southwestern Virginia, and the end of slavery there was not suddenly announced one day as it was in Texas. Men and women enslaved at Smithfield had known from the start what the Civil War was about. On a neighboring plantation, one of the enslaved men often talked about the prospect of freedom the war offered: “he gloried in the hope of the yankees gaining the day that he might be free.” During the war, word of the Emancipation Proclamation spread quickly on and around Smithfield, and Union troops passed by twice, bringing with them a chance for enslaved individuals to escape and make real the freedom promised by President Lincoln.</p>\n<p>When the war finally ended and slavery collapsed entirely at Smithfield, the families that had been enslaved there moved quickly to take advantage of their freedom. They reunited with spouses, children, and other kin separated by sale or the division of an owner’s estate, and working with their neighbors they established Black churches, Black schools, Black mutual aid societies, and other components of a distinctive African American community. And through the close of the nineteenth century they held their “day of jubilee” on January 1, the date on which the Emancipation Proclamation had been signed.</p>\n<p>As early as 1869, freedpeople around Smithfield celebrated their emancipation on January 1. They often gathered at churches because they were the most common spaces controlled by African Americans and provided places where they could assemble and speak openly with less chance of White interference. Their celebrations were not just religious events, though. Certainly, they often involved prayers and hymns, but the Emancipation Proclamation was read, there were sometimes fireworks or ice-cream, and there was always “general rejoicing.” Into the twentieth century Emancipation Day was the most noteworthy coming together of African Americans in Virginia.\nThe early twentieth century, however, was a time of increasing difficulty for African Americans in Virginia. A new state constitution denied them virtually any role in political or legal life; Jim Crow legislation subjected them to increasingly restrictive racial segregation; and they were frequently excluded from new, more rewarding economic opportunities. As a result, many of the children and grandchildren of those who had been enslaved at Smithfield left Virginia to start new lives in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, Montana, and California. In doing so, they often left behind some of the traditions they had known in Virginia. And as the African American community from which they emigrated grew smaller, some of those traditions faded there, too—including Emancipation Day.</p>\n<p>For the descendants of those who were enslaved at Smithfield, Juneteenth provides a renewed occasion to remember the struggles and the victories of their ancestors. More broadly, it gives the rest of us a similar opportunity to mourn the damage slavery did to this nation, to celebrate the benefits that emancipation brought to all of us, and to recognize the necessity for further progress toward realizing our national ideals.</p>\n<p>-Daniel B.

I’m born with it,” said an elderly, formerly enslaved man to the White folklorist and radio show host John Henry Faulk. Faulk had been explaining to the man “what a different kind of White man I was,” telling the older gentleman that he was in favor of <em><strong>giving</strong></em> Black people civil rights and <em><strong>giving</strong></em> them access to education and <em><strong>giving</strong></em> them any job for which they were qualified. Faulk admitted to initially being stunned and angered by the elder’s retort. Although Faulk had an epiphany in that moment, namely that the old man was correct and that being an ally meant fighting the social restrictions to this natural right, many Americans still suffer from the disease of privilege that plagued Faulk. Significantly, Juneteenth is an exploded manifestation of that same, simple eloquence that an open mind can learn from but that the privileged wish to silence.</p>\n<p>Juneteenth is a subversive celebration because it centers the experiences of the formerly enslaved instead of social and political elites. Just as importantly, Juneteenth illuminates the wicked alchemy of White Supremacy. When Union soldiers landed in Galveston, Texas in June 1865 to declare that the American Civil War was over and that all slaves were free, they did so three years after Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation and months since the seditionist Confederacy had surrendered at Appomattox, Virginia. Moreover, it was countless years and months after thousands of enslaved Black people had fled to Mexico to try to create freedom for themselves. Some scholars estimate that as many as 10,000 enslaved people used this southern route of the Underground Railroad to escape American Exceptionalism. After all, Mexico had outlawed slavery in 1829, a fact that angered the White slave-owning settlers who had moved into its northern province of Texas. It does not take much imagination to see that spirit of liberty fanning the Mexican resistance to the French-imposed emperor, Maximillian (a member of the Habsburg royalty), who came to power during our deadly, internecine conflict. Black people supported the resistance and as the military tide turned against the emperor, he invited ex-Confederates to move to Mexico as a way of shoring up his position. When the Liberal forces of President Benito Juarez and General Porfirio Diaz captured Maximillian, they executed him, interestingly enough, on Juneteenth 1867.</p>\n<p>In my hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee, we did not grow up celebrating Juneteenth because August 8th was our “Emancipation Day:” the day that future president Andrew Johnson freed his slaves in East Tennessee. Over time, Juneteenth and other Emancipation Days grew into more than a celebration of the past. They became platforms for Black economic and cultural expression, for exercises in bodily autonomy nearly unthinkable on any other day of the year. In addition, some Emancipation Days became venues for labor and political organizing, especially when doing so in plain sight might get you killed. More recently, the push to have Juneteenth recognized as a holiday is as much about compelling all Americans to acknowledge the long road ahead of us, as well as grappling with the sinful past behind us. UVA Press’s new book series “The Black Soldier in War and Society,” which I co-edit with Le’Trice Donaldson, serves a similar purpose, albeit on a smaller scale.</p>\n<p>The end of American slavery was not freedom; it was simply the termination of one type of bondage. The works that will appear in our book series will reflect the ongoing and multifaceted quest for freedom as demonstrated by Black people who wore the uniform of the United States military, the experiences of the families of service members, and the ways that all of them fought—and keep fighting—for justice in their communities. Since millions of our fellow citizens remain willing to drum up ghosts and rely on irrational fears of exaggerated threats to deny us the many exercises of our freedoms, our book series is both timely and will be in keeping with the unadorned defiance of an old freedman: “You can’t give me the right to be a human being. I’m born with it.”</p>\n<p>george white, jr.

Blacksburg is less than 200 miles from Charlottesville but the university communities joined hands in grief.

The flag was the only one that he kept for himself and was finally placed in his family’s mausoleum in the church of Macharaviaya, the Gálvez family’s hometown, in Andalusia. It was kept until 1903 when his descendants donated it to the Museo del Ejército (Spanish Army Museum).</p>\n<p>A manuscript note in French, accompanying the case in which the flag was preserved, tells of a remarkable story.</p>\n<p>“When the French wanted to enter the village during the War of Independence (1808-14), the population took this flag, and to the cry of ‘Gálvez!’, they drove back the enemy.” (<em>Bandera británica capturada por Bernardo de Gálvez durante sus campañas en América</em>, 1781. Museo del Ejército, no. inv. 40390.)</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, no record has been found about the reaction of the French soldiers after being attacked by a group of Andalusian peasants rallied under a British flag.</p>\n<p>During his campaigns in the southern theater of operations of the American Revolutionary War, Bernardo de Gálvez routinely defeated the British forces, beginning in Manchac, where he captured by surprise Fort Bute in September 1779. Shortly afterwards, Baton Rouge surrendered after a short siege. Having secured his rearguard alongside the Mississippi, and after returning to New Orleans for reinforcements~~,~~ in early January 1780, he departed for Mobile, which was also captured after a week-long siege.</p>\n<p>Pensacola, the next objective, would not be conquered as easily as Mobile. Britain’s main stronghold in West Florida, Pensacola was well defended and prepared against a military incursion. Gálvez needed more troops and ships from Havana which were supposed to be sent to Mobile for the final push. Although reinforcements arrived in Mobile after its surrender, the size of the force was inadequate to ensure success. Gálvez had no choice but to return to New Orleans and then continue on to Havana. In Havana, the high command was extremely wary of Gálvez, whom they considered too young and inexperienced to be entrusted with such an important mission. A mission that~~,~~ furthermore, was deemed secondary to the defense of Havana, which, incidentally, had been occupied by the British in 1762-3.</p>\n<p>Following protracted negotiations, an expedition against Pensacola left Havana in October 1780. But only two days after setting sail, a strong storm wrecked part of the fleet dispersing the rest throughout the Caribbean. When Gálvez returned empty-handed to Havana, his critics believed his career was over, but with the decisive support of the Secretary for the Indias, José de Gálvez, Bernardo’s uncle, he managed to prepare a new expedition, launched in late February 1781. This time the weather was fair and the fleet reached Pensacola Bay a few days later. After resolving a disagreement with the naval officer in command of the fleet, who initially refused to sail inside the harbor, the Spanish troops finally disembarked and lay siege, an effort that resulted in the capitulation of the British forces on May 10, 1781.</p>\n<p>Between June 1778, when Spain declared war against Britain, and September 1783, when the peace treaties were signed, Bernardo de Gálvez captured more than a dozen British flags and standards, both from Army units and from British ships: four of them were on display in Santiago de Compostela’s cathedral as late as 1880; four others in the Basilica de Nuestra Señora del Pilar (Basilica of Our Lady of the Pilar) in Saragossa until at least 1920; several others in Seville’s cathedral disappeared sometime around 1812 when they were taken down in order not to offend the British allies after Napoleon’s defeat; those remaining flags were sent to Aranjuez and not seen after 1788.</p>\n<p>While displaying captured enemies’ flags in public spaces was customary in continental Europe, it was unusual in the British Isles.  Captured Spanish colors hanged over the Ridderzaal in the Binnenhof in The Hague, when the representatives of the seven regions of the Dutch Republic met in 1651 and decided that since the war was over, they did not need to appoint a new stadholder. Another instance was when in November 1914, during the first stages of the First World War, the French hanged eight German colors in the platform just below the organ of the cathedral of Saint-Louis des Invalides in Paris.</p>\n<p>While in Britain, churches were embellished not with enemies’ flags but with their own country’s regimental colors, as even today in St. Patrick’s cathedral in Dublin with dozens of those standards representing the Irishmen who served in British units. The flags were, and still are, left to be hanged and decay as a tribute to the old saying that “Soldiers do not die, they simply fade away”. Although enemies’ flags were generally kept by the regiments who captured them, at least once however, the British did hang them in a cathedral. In 1806, for the solemn funeral of Lord Nelson in St. Paul's Cathedral, two huge Spanish and French flags flanked the coffin. To the left, the naval ensign, captured from the 74-gun Spanish warship, <em>San Ildefonso</em> in the battle of Trafalgar; and to the right probably the one taken from the <em>Généreux</em>, also a 74-gun, sunk in 1800 near Malta.</p>\n<p>The image of the British tattered flag shows its original condition before being restored, in its present state one can observe that the renovation went beyond preserving the much-tattered flag and was mostly “recreated”, thus, in our opinion losing an important part of its original appeal. It perfectly represents the excellent performance of the Spanish Army during the American Revolutionary War, in which it was almost always victorious in land. The Spanish Navy did not enjoy similar success, but that is another story.</p>\n<p>~Gabriel Paquette and Gonzalo M.

Over the years as I have studied the convention, one entry in George Washington’s diary from May 1787 nagged at me. The convention was supposed to start on Monday, May 14. Washington arrived in Philadelphia the day before and waited as delegates slowly trickled into town. He drank tea at Robert Morris’s house: “The State of New York was represented. Dined at a club at Greys ferry over the Schuylkill &#x26; drank Tea at Mr. Morris’s— after wch. went with Mrs. Morris &#x26; some other Ladies to hear a lady read at the College Hall.” He capitalized the first “Ladies,” and left the lady herself lowercase, implying a distinction between the anonymous lady and Mary White Morris, the spouse of financier and delegate Robert Morris, and her friends, possibly including Elizabeth Willing Powel. Who was this lady? What was she doing giving a lecture at what later became the University of Pennsylvania? What relationship did she have to the Constitution and the framing era?</p>\n<p>This book recovers in full the life of this one woman, Eliza Harriot Barons O’Connor, an educator and advocate for female capacity, and to an extent that of her spouse, John O’Connor, a lawyer by training, and tells their story to illuminate the ways in which the developing American constitutional state confronted and eventually excluded people based on sex. I approach this period through the lens of constitution and as part of the Age of the Constitution. Her presence reveals the view of female education represented by Benjamin Rush and other writers associated with “republican motherhood” as a centrist, conservative argument. The critical year—1792—becomes here a moment in a rising transatlantic trajectory with education as the foundation of female participation in the constitutional state, rather than the starting point in a narrative about women’s political rights. By viewing Eliza Harriot’s life through this lens, we can see the crucial analytical relationship among education, suffrage, and officeholding. And we can reflect on the fluid and shifting arguments that created nineteenth-century female disenfranchisement and its long legacy. . . .</p>\n<p>In seeking to reframe the constitutional politics of gender in the 1780s, I do not deny the pervasive view throughout this period of the state as white male gendered. Washington’s relationship to the conventional understanding of women in relation to American political power appears in Edward Savage’s <em>The Washington Family.</em> Here we see Washington, his wife, her grandchildren, and an enslaved Black man, with a less precisely detailed face, possibly William Lee. The omission of a figure representing enslaved women—for example, Ona Judge, who would escape from the Washingtons in 1796—furthers the racial and gender hierarchy. Washington’s political power appears in conversation with his blended family and the representation of enslaved dependents. And Savage’s arrangement places the two white men on one side and the women and person of color on the other to emphasize who—hand on the globe—holds power. George gets a sword; Martha a fan pointing to “the grand avenue” (Pennsylvania Avenue), the location of the future White House. She has a certain type of power, but it appears domestic and subordinate, in the same class as young girls, servants, and the enslaved. The patriarchal family is here the patriarchal country. This view was loud and ever present. Had there been polls in the 1780s and 1790s, perhaps they would have reflected the view’s dominance.</p>\n<p>George Washington’s presence in the subtitle of this book and his reappearance throughout the narrative serves as a constant reminder of that reality. Eliza Harriot’s 1787 lecture in Philadelphia received widespread newspaper coverage because of Washington’s attendance. Her letters survive because she wrote them to him. Moreover, Eliza Harriot recognized Washington’s political and cultural power and enlisted it for her purposes. As a sophisticated observer of the patronage politics of the Atlantic world, she repeatedly sought Washington’s public approbation of female genius. The realities of political power barred her entry from employments and appointments that would bring the fame to justify a solely self-titled biography. As “Mrs. O’Connor,” her story might be ignored as that of one failed female schoolteacher’s tale. In contemporaneous newspapers, she appeared as “The Lady”—an anonymous descriptor she herself chose, one that represented both herself and unknown others. In the title, she is Eliza Harriot—the first name that she used in her correspondence and the only one over which she had personal control. Her intertwined path with Washington mirrors the inextricable relationship between gender equality and political authority in this period.</p>\n<p>Eliza Harriot shows us that there were other strands and beliefs competing with the white, male political vision represented by Washington. People lived their lives to make real a counter-vision. Historical writing is not always particularly good at demonstrating what we know to be true about our own time, that there are many voices. The one that seems to hold power is not the one that may reflect our deepest commitments or the path by which many live their lives. This erasure of multiple voices is, of course, exacerbated by the privileging of the published record and of private papers of public figures. But it was a framing generation that created the Constitution as a system of government.</p>\n<p>During the 1780s, in England, Ireland, France, and the new United States, glimmerings could be found of the belief that women were full persons, with equal intellectual capacity, deserving of education, capable of debating politics, and able to occupy public rhetorical spaces conventionally reserved for men. Intriguingly, the Constitution was drafted in this space with dynamic possibilities. And Eliza Harriot’s presence in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 provides evidence that the stylistic, gender-neutral formula used to describe officeholders was a response to this broader expansive vision about women’s role in the political state.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Happy Presidents' Day!

Hauerwas</strong></p>\n<p>         “I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth”—Lou Gehrig.  Though I never aspired to be a first baseman for the Yankees—Jon Stock must bear that burden—Gehrig’s sentiments expressed at his retirement due to his ALS illness says what I feel on being recognized by the SCE.  My only hesitation by expressing myself using Gehrig’s words is Christian ambiguity about the concept of luck.  Impressed by the sheer contingency of our lives, we are born and then we die, the Stoics learned to live without resentment.  The Stoics were morally impressive, but I am not a Stoic.  I am a Christian.</p>\n<p>         The difference Christianity makes is expressed by Gehrig’s next sentence that explains why he feels so lucky.  “I have been in ballparks for 17years and have never received anything but kindness and encouragement from you fans.”  The Society of Christian Ethics is not exactly a ballpark but it is one of the fields on which I have played.  I cannot say as Gehrig does that I always received from members of the SCE the kind of encouragement he enjoyed from fans in the many ballparks in which he played.  Yet I am sure playing at the SCE made me a better fielder.  It is true, however, that I still cannot hit a curve ball.    </p>\n<p>         I am still working but extra innings do not last forever.  I have already had more extra innings than many.  As you might expect I am not good at knowing how to come to an end.  But in <em>The Art of Worldly Wisdom</em>, Baltasar Gracian, the worldly-wise Spanish Jesuit, advises:</p>\n<p>Make yourself wanted.  Few have won popular favor; consider yourself fortunate if you can win the favor of the wise.  People are usually lukewarm toward those at the end of their careers. There are ways to win and keep the grand prize of favor.  You can be outstanding in your occupation and in your talents.  A pleasant manner works too.  Turn eminence into dependence, so that people will say that the occupation needed you, and not vice versa.  Some people honor their position, others are honored by it.  It is no honor to be made good by a bad person who (may) succeed(s) you. The fact that someone else is hated doesn’t mean that you are truly wanted.</p>\n<p>It is tempting to describe Gracian as a cynic but I think that a mistake.  He is rather an insightful commentator on the human condition.  I should like to think that I may have said or written something from time to time some of you found useful if not insightful. I was recently introduced by a friend who suggested that once you see what I have seen you cannot unsee it.  That which cannot be unseen I hope makes possible insights that not only enrich our work as Christian theologians and ethicists, a division of labor I have long resisted, but might even help us to live lives of virtue.</p>\n<p>That our work as theologians and ethicists might have something to do with how we live can be dismissed as pretentious bullshit.  MacIntyre, for example, challenges the presumption that the teaching of ethics might make students ethical by asking if you can observe any difference the teaching of ethics makes on those that do the teaching.  MacIntyre presumes we would find it hard to answer that question in the affirmative. </p>\n<p>That such is the case I think is a major challenge for the future of the SCE.  The challenge being whether we know what we are doing when we teach ethics.  Are we trying to help those we teach as well as ourselves know how to be better human beings?  If so by what authority do we undertake that task?  Moreover if insight is a characteristic of those who are good how do we become as well as train others to be insightful? </p>\n<p>Before we can make headway on that those questions we have to ask if we have any idea what makes an insight an insight.  Insights seem to come from nowhere but once articulated the insight seems obvious.  The grammar of the language used to express the insight, moreover, is constitutive of the insight.  I think many of us became ethicists because of insights learned from the study of those with whom we may even disagree but who have said what we cannot help but think is true.  Which raises the question from where do insights come?  Are they dependent on the training a person receives or do they reflect the humanity that some people seem to have?</p>\n<p>I recently received a lovely letter from a graduate of Duke Divinity School reporting that by reading some of my work I had become an unsettling yet comforting voice in her head.  According to her I have challenged what many assume are the givens by doing something as weird and angular as questioning word usage.  She compares the way I think to a plane that comes in from an unexpected direction but is nonetheless able to land upside down.  I always find such letters humbling and frightening suggesting as they do something I have written may have screwed up someone life. </p>\n<p>My correspondent continues by suggesting that, like Emily Dickinson, I think on a slant.  She then asks how can she learn to think in a similar fashion?  Are there habits or texts in order to learn not just what I do, but how I do it?  I would love to know how to answer her but I am not sure how to say what I have done or how I did it.  My best advice is to ask those who have studied with me.  They often know the what and how to do what I have done better than I do.</p>\n<p>That I am often unable to say how I came to say what I have said this way rather than that way I take not to be a bad thing.  After all it gives me and all of us that make up the SCE something to do.  And what could be a better gift as we approach death than having good but never finished work to do.  So engaged we might even become at this late date just a bit better human beings.  At the very least I know the friends that have claimed me through the SCE have made me more than I otherwise would be.  Which is why this award means a great deal—thank you for such a recognition.       </p>\n<!--EndFragment-->\n<p><em>Photo courtesy of Duke Divinity School.</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Stanley Hauerwas, author of Fully Alive, Receives 2022 Lifetime Achievement Award from The Society of Christian Ethics","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"5773","Title":"Fully Alive"}],"date":"2022-02-08"},"fields":{"slug":"/stanley-hauerwas-author-of-fully-alive-receives-2022-lifetime-achievement-award-from-the-society-of-christian-ethics"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>We are pleased to offer this original blog post in honor of MLK Day by Emily K.

This is the heart of their program. To end humiliation was a start, but to end poverty is a bigger task. It is natural for Negroes to turn to the Labor movement because it was the first and pioneer anti-poverty program.”</p>\n<p>Because Martin Luther King, Jr., advocated for unions and workers’ rights, his birthday is a fitting opportunity to examine domestic labor, the occupation of most African American women in the early twentieth century. Our book, <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5693\"><em>Limited Choices: Mable Jones, a Black Children’s Nurse in a Northern White Household</em>,</a> introduces a woman who was a household worker for more than seventy years. Mable Jones was sixteen in 1925, when she first arrived in Charlottesville, Virginia, from a rural area with her widowed mother and four siblings. Three years earlier, she had begun her long career in domestic work. “I used to wash dishes for somebody in a home and go to school,” she told an interviewer. Mable Jones left school after eighth grade because, she said, “I wanted to get a better job and help my mother. She raised five children.” In Charlottesville, Mable Jones’s mother hoped to find better schools for her younger children and higher paid jobs for her daughters and herself. The tightening grip of Jim Crow, however, prevented her from fully attaining either goal. In the end, Mable Jones remained a household worker until she was 85, long after many African American women had found other occupations.</p>\n<p>A quarter century after Mable Jones’s death, it is still all too easy to find evidence of systemic injustice in the kind of employment she held. Today, most of the 2.5 million private household workers in the United States are immigrant women from Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America. In significant ways, however, domestic service remains remarkably similar to the occupation Mable Jones entered a century ago. Household workers are now entitled to receive Social Security, but fewer than 9 percent of employers pay into the system. In addition, domestic workers still lack basic job protections. Three major pieces of legislation -- the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1967, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1971 – do not cover those in jobs with single employees. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 explicitly excludes domestic workers.</p>\n<p> With few legal safeguards, private household workers remain vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Nearly a fourth are paid beneath the state minimum wage; more than two thirds receive less than $14 an hour. As many as sixty percent spend more than half of their wages on housing. A third of them reported working long hours without a break in the past year; another third reported having been injured or exposed to toxic chemicals on the job. Fearful of deportation, undocumented workers are especially wary of complaining about employment conditions.</p>\n<p>And household service work continues to tear families apart. When Mable Jones lived in her employers’ homes, sometimes several states away from Virginia, she left her children in the care of her mother. Today, large numbers of workers still leave children behind, in the care of grandparents and other kin. Although some take advantage of modern communication methods like Skype and Zoom, the periods and distances of separation are far greater than they were for Mable and her sons. Undocumented workers face overwhelming obstacles when they try to travel home or bring their children to the United States.</p>\n<p>As an isolated and largely invisible labor force, domestic workers are notoriously difficult to organize. New groups of activists, however, have taken up the challenge. Founded in 2007, the National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA) is a network of advocacy organizations including four local chapters and 63 affiliate groups. The director is Ai-jen Poo, the child of Taiwanese immigrant parents and a recipient of a MacArthur “genius grant.” Poo views herself as building on the successes of her predecessors, most notably Dorothy Lee Bolden, who helped workers in Atlanta win inclusion in labor laws in the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to launching a broad-based political campaign, the NDWA sponsored the first national survey of household workers, drafted a Domestic Workers Bill of Rights (including overtime pay, one day off each week, and protection under state human rights laws), and then lobbied to secure its passage in Congress and various state legislatures. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the group raised money to provide emergency assistance to domestic workers to enable them to stay home. Poo acknowledges that bringing household workers together to fight for better employment conditions might be “a never-ending project.”</p>\n<p>Although this has arrived too late for Mable Jones and the many women of her generation, the emergence of a powerful new movement for workers’ rights offers considerable hope. Its current initiatives will help to make King's dream a reality.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Martin Luther King., Jr., Workers' Rights, and Domestic Labor, An Original Post by Emily K.

I’ve never been a Black Friday shopper, not even before the pandemic made the idea scary. Instead, I hang out with the family I’ve flown to see, making turkey soup and joining my husband and niece around the piano for show tunes—he plays, she sings, both extremely well. She’s a mezzo. This year it was a joyous visit, cozily together again after two years. Little did we know when she gave us the Baker’s Wife’s “Moments in the Woods” (from <em>Into the Woods</em>) that I was hearing what became—in my mind, at least—the first of many tribute songs to great composer-lyricist Stephen Sondheim, whom the world lost earlier that day.</p>\n<p>Like everyone mourning Sondheim, I have always been a fan, not from my first cigarette (I’ve never smoked), but certainly till my last dying day. While I don’t have the chops of the stars Lin-Manuel Miranda led in “Sunday” from <em>Sunday in the Park with George</em> in Duffy Square on November 29th (all of whom have performed Sondheim one way or another), I have exercised what talents I do have—research and writing—in working with his genius in other ways, devoting a chapter to <em>Sweeney Todd</em> in my book <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5450\">Victorians on Broadway: Literature, Adaptation, and the Modern American Musical</a> (published by UVA Press in 2020). It was an extraordinary honor to interview Sondheim for it. I literally fell off my chair when I first saw “STEPHEN SONDHEIM” in my email inbox, and I do not use the word “literally” in a figurative sense. Our correspondence started a little stiffly with titles and honorifics, but we ended up with Sharon and Steve. He was wonderfully gracious. One thing he said that I will describe made the whole book—not just the chapter on <em>Sweeney Todd</em>—much better. </p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5450\"><em>Victorians on Broadway</em>,</a> I examine Broadway musicals based on Victorian literature, such as <em>Oliver!</em>, <em>The King and I</em>, <em>Drood</em>, <em>Jekyll and Hyde</em>, and of course <em>Sweeney Todd</em>. I examine aspects of novels by Charles Dickens or Robert Louis Stevenson that predispose them to musical theater adaptation, and I examine how adapters use these books to perform cultural work for the moment of performance. The book argues that no matter who wrote the source text (whether Charlotte Brontë or a penny-dreadful hack), once a Victorian tale becomes a Broadway musical, it brims with characters, themes, and a mise-en-scène that recall Dickens or prior adaptations of Dickens. An example is the relationship between <em>Sweeney Todd</em> and <em>Oliver!</em>, a musical that Sondheim told me that he did not see as a precursor to his own. And yet there are surprising similarities. For example, <em>Sweeney Todd</em> imports the large singing Beadle Bamford, a villainous tenor, into a narrative that included no Beadle of importance in the source. Where did he come from? Mr. Bumble, another villainous tenor Beadle, is a very large presence in <em>Oliver!</em></p>\n<p>And who corroborated this argument? Sondheim himself. I asked him what he thought of or pictured when he envisioned Victorianness, and he answered “I just hear Dickens, I think Dickens. Dickens movies I’ve seen, and the couple of novels of his I’ve read.” Not only for Sondheim but for Broadway in general, Victorian equals Dickensian.</p>\n<p>In addition to giving me this wonderful quote that sums up the book’s argument, Sondheim gave me something else through the format of our interview. I emailed him my questions, and he recorded his answers to them over a period of several weeks between about December 19 and December 25, 2012. I expected an mp3 file by email, but instead, around January 14, 2013, a cassette tape arrived by snail mail. There it was, in my hand, with my name on it in his handwriting.

As Democrats scurry to learn the lessons of last Tuesday’s performance, here are a few to consider:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The nationalization of state politics is stronger today than at any time in decades.  Virginia Democrats pushed and passed popular initiatives during their years in control of state government--Medicaid expansion, the ERA, minimum wage increases, gun safety measures, and despite the rhetoric of “defund the police,” enhanced funding for law enforcement.   But many voters were not focused on what Democrats were doing in Richmond. Instead, they were angry with what Democrats were <em>not</em> doing in Washington. Most voters do not become enmeshed in internecine party scrabbles between progressives and moderates. They want results.  Right now, they are not getting them from DC, and Democrats are taking the blame.</li>\n<li>Schools and parents’ matter.  Mr. Youngkin<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/11/02/us/election-news/election-takeaways\"> seized on</a> Mr. McAuliffe’s remark that he didn’t “believe parents should be telling schools what they should teach,” and thereby undermined the former governor’s promise to make “historic” investments in education and teacher salaries.  E<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2021/exit-polls-virginia-governor/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21\">xit polling</a> reported that a supermajority of Virginia voters believe parents should have a voice in what schools teach their children.  Youngkin’s positioning undermined a key element of the Democratic coalition--suburban women.  Two counties where Democrats had gained substantially in recent years illustrate <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-republicans-won-the-virginia-governors-race/\">the change</a>.   In Loudoun County, McAuliffe won by 11 percent, but this pales in comparison to Biden’s 25-point margin in 2020. Similarly, Democrats had won Chesterfield, a traditionally red county adjacent to Richmond, by 7 points in 2020, only to lose it by 11 this year. Finally, McAuliffe dramatically underperformed with women. Biden won this key constituency by 23 points.  Despite McAuliffe’s support for reproductive rights, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/03/why-are-democrats-struggling-politically-so-much-right-now/\">exit polls</a> indicate that he won this group by only six points. Education, a uniquely state issue where Democrats had dominated, had been weaponized against them. Expect this to become a key element in the GOP strategy in the midterms.</li>\n<li>We remain incredibly divided into our respective political tribes.  There was little ticket-splitting in Virginia, and that resulted in Democratic losses in close races up and down the ticket. Youngkin’s victory was neither a landslide nor a mandate.  If it had occurred 10 years ago, it would have appeared to be just another Republican victory.  But the formerly reliable red state has changed in the last two decades--and a GOP win is therefore perceived as disruptive.  </li>\n<li>Voting rights matter.   Virginia democrats made voting much easier, instituting no-excuse early voting for 45 days prior to the election.  It is one reason why the Commonwealth saw the <a href=\"https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/2021-election-turnout/\">largest turnout for a governor's race</a> in recent history--by a lot.   Much of the early vote came from reliably red areas across the state.  Even as McAuliffe won 600,000 more votes than in 2013 and 200,000 more than Northam’s total in 2017, Republican turnout overwhelmed the Democrats, especially in traditionally red areas, where some <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/03/virginia-votes-shift-democrats-republicans/\">increases were greater than 40 percent</a>.</li>\n<li>Diversity is not Destiny.  The change in the demographic mix in Virginia has been thought to be a major cause of the rise in Democratic electoral strength in the state, which led to victories in 14 of the last 21 statewide elections, wins in every presidential contest since Obama in 2008, and the election of two Democratic U.S. Senators.  But this year, it was not decisive.  Youngkin made inroads in the African American and Hispanic communities.  In addition, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2021/exit-polls-virginia-governor/\"> exit polls</a> suggest that  white Virginians accounted for 74 percent of voters, up from 67 percent last year.</li>\n<li>Trump was a factor, but not in the way that was expected.  Youngkin was masterful in saying enough to mobilize Trump voters while never explicitly being tied to the former President. In 2017, polling for Virginia House races suggested that our candidates needed to talk about issues besides Trump to win; by 2019, everything was about Trump.  In 2021, some of the anti-Trump energy for Virginia Democrats had dissipated.  And exit polls showed that many independents, many of whom were extremely uncomfortable with Trump, broke for Youngkin.  Virginians were ready to move on, and while the former President attempted to take credit for the GOP wins, there is little evidence of it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Control of the country begins in the states, and Virginia is typically viewed as a bellwether of political trends in the nation.  If this election provides us any guidance, Democrats have a lot to do, both in the states and in Washington.</p>\n<p>David J.

We thank them for their thoughtful response below. </p>\n<p><strong>************</strong>*</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2020, while reviewing final proofs of <em><a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5389\">Black Landscapes Matter,</a></em> someone congratulated us. The book, which we had quietly been working on for the past several years, had climbed to the top of a list of best-selling books on Amazon.</p>\n<p>There was some panic associated with that news. How could the work live up to expectations that so many people had in that moment? In the aftermath of the most recent horrific injustice within the American landscape—George Floyd’s murder—people were demanding answers and ways out of the current 400-year-long paradigm. <em>Black Landscapes Matter</em> could only open a door toward resolutions and alternative futures. The book itself wasn’t going to alter racialized experiences in a landscape, or change how our public spaces include or exclude or erase certain people, or unspool the blanket of white supremacy threaded into the country’s built fabric. It didn’t seem like enough.</p>\n<p>Yet there was little else like it. And any action toward change had to first begin with a conversation.</p>\n<p>As the book’s November publication neared, we wondered what the book would be had it been conceived after George Floyd’s death. What would it be if we solicited the authors to write essays in November 2021? What questions would we ask differently? What assumptions would be different? How had our country’s conversations, understandings of history, and willingness to embody the consciousness of others shifted? Or—conversely—sometimes one wonders what, concretely, has changed at all.</p>\n<p>But we try to have faith that the country’s consciousness is shifting. The authors of <em><a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5389\">Black Landscapes Matter</a></em> presaged much of the energy, demands, reflections, and calls to action that transpired last summer. In 2020, the country—and globe—was starting their reckoning on racism, but the authors had been immersed in these realities long before, as their writing affirms. The book just happened to come into the world in 2020.</p>\n<p>From Austin Allen and Kofi Boone’s writings questioning the status quo of our country’s design education, to Sara Daleiden’s case study demonstrating the challenges of designing public space in a city scarred by racial trauma: suddenly, many more people than we could have imagined were, too, interested in these issues, opening their eyes to the ingrained racism and injustices of our country’s built environment.</p>\n<p>*<a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5389\">Black Landscapes Matter </a>*offers just a glimpse into these injustices. We hope the topics raised by the authors have facilitated conversations needed to catalyze change, especially at a moment when so many people are now ready to have those conversations. The authors, all of whom write at the intersection of their personal experience and professional interests, attest to the abiding individual stake all of us have in the design of our built environment. And, though grounded in the specificity of place, they also speak to the fact that nearly any landscape or city in this country possesses a racially unjust history it must face—and its own Black geography to be celebrated and elevated.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5389\">Black Landscapes Matter</a></em> is, like the racial reckonings of 2020, only a starting point; our work continues.</p>\n<p><strong>About the Author(s):</strong> </p>\n<p>Walter Hood is a MacArthur Fellow and Professor of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning and Urban Design at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>\n<p>Grace Mitchell Tada is an independent scholar, writer, and journalist.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Celebrating UP Week (#KeepUp) with Grace Mitchell Tada and Walter Hood, Coeditors of BLACK LANDSCAPES MATTER","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"5389","Title":"Black Landscapes Matter"}],"date":"2021-11-09"},"fields":{"slug":"/celebrating-up-week-keepup-with-grace-mitchell-tada-and-walter-hood-coeditors-of-black-landscapes-matter"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>We share today in mourning the loss of Linwood Holton, Virginia's First GOP Governor in the Twentieth Century and Giant of Civil Rights, who died yesterday at 98.</p>\n<p>From the <em><a href=\"https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/linwood-holton-virginias-first-gop-governor-of-the-20th-century-who-embraced-civil-rights-dies/article_2ddcdeb8-178d-5f8e-9dab-10d95f22181f.html\">Richmond Times-Dispatch:</a></em></p>\n<p>\"Linwood Holton, vanguard of two-party competition in once solidly Democratic Virginia as its first Republican governor of the 20th century and whose progressive views on race and public investment ultimately isolated him from a GOP that would lurch right in an alliance with the Old South conservatives he long opposed, died Thursday morning at his home in Kilmarnock.

The filibuster should die, and the sooner the better. We all, Republicans and Democrats alike, would be much better off without it.</p>\n<p>Amid the deadlock over raising the debt ceiling, Democrats were poised to further limit the filibuster by manufacturing another ad hoc exception to Rule XXII. Rule XXII is the Senate rule that defines <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_index_subjects/Cloture_vrd.htm\">cloture</a> – a motion to bring debate to a close – and requires a supermajority of at least 60 votes on most matters under consideration. The 60-vote threshold is what empowers filibusters or minority obstruction and can prevent a final vote on legislation.</p>\n<p>In 2013 under Democratic control and 2017 with the Republicans in the majority, the Senate eliminated that supermajority barrier for all nominations to the executive and judicial branches. This was done via the so-called nuclear option. Instead of voting to rewrite Rule XXII, a majority of the Senate used a parliamentary ruling to reinterpret the application of Rule XXII. This narrowed the reach of the filibuster without changing the actual rule.</p>\n<p>Last week Democrats were considering another such parliamentary ruling to exclude consideration of debt ceiling increases from the reach of filibusters; so it would take only a simple majority to end debate on any measure about the government’s ability to borrow. With the temporary extension approved last Thursday, another threat to change the filibuster has been set aside, for now.</p>\n<p>Senators typically justify their opposition to reforming or ending the filibuster with some threadbare notion of the Senate’s essential role in the government as intended by the framers, or that the filibuster compels deliberation, or fosters bipartisan compromise. But these are either completely false or misleading. It’s about political power, not constitutional principle. When push comes to shove, the vast majority of Senators prefer their individual and partisan power over better government.</p>\n<p>The filibuster was never about deliberation, meaning reasoned argument aimed at persuasion. But the latest episode with the debt and the machinations of Minority Leader McConnell show that it is not even about coerced compromise or bipartisanship (which is at best what Senators really mean by \"deliberation\"). It's simply about thwarting the other party. It's about the next election. The filibuster is a decision rule that empowers the minority to obstruct or veto.</p>\n<p>And, as America looked on in some combination of wonder and confusion, instead of insisting on debate or deliberation supposedly engendered by supermajority cloture, McConnell was (and still is) demanding that Democrats evade the filibuster through the budget reconciliation process to change the debt limit. Why? Because in this particular circumstance it is the better way to \"own\" the Democrats to make their lives miserable to stymie the president's agenda. And it does not matter which party is abusing Senate rules. That’s not the point.</p>\n<p>The filibuster is about partisan and individual power and nothing else. It has nothing to do with better or safer government; and it never has been about those things.</p>\n<p>James Madison warned against majority tyranny, but majority tyranny only mattered over the long run with persistent dangers to a clear minority. Majority rule does not equal majority tyranny. Majority rule is the inescapable basis of republican government. Madison also warned against minority factions. They could be troublesome, but further measures were not warranted because they would be defeated – at least before the filibuster -- \"by the republican principle\" of majority rule. And in general the founders worried more about minority power than majority tyranny.</p>\n<p>If through Senate rules a minority can thwart the majority, a majority that can represent a majority of the House, a majority of the states, and the president (along with public opinion), that's the definition of minority tyranny. A form of tyranny that negates the purpose of elections and thwarts the constitutional architecture of policy-making.</p>\n<p>The filibuster has nothing to do with the Constitution or the framers’ view of the Senate’s function in the architecture of the national government. The solution is quite simple. Rather than piecemeal changes to the <em>interpretation</em> of the filibuster rule, the rule should be rewritten. Rule XXII could and should be rewritten to allow simple majority closure of debate on any issue before the Senate following a specified and guaranteed period of debate. That change would combine deliberation and majority rule and return the Senate to its constitutional role in the operation of Congress and the national government.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why the Filibuster Must Go: Op-Ed by Daniel Wirls, Author of THE SENATE","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"5694","Title":"The Senate"}],"date":"2021-10-18"},"fields":{"slug":"/why-the-filibuster-must-go-op-ed-by-daniel-wirls-author-of-the-senate"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>We are delighted to offer this blog post by Margaret Grubiak, author of <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5322\">MONUMENTAL JESUS: Landscapes of Faith and Doubt in Modern America,</a> on the new film <em>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</em> and Heritage, USA in Fort Mill, South Carolina. </p>\n<p><strong>************</strong>* </p>\n<p>In the new film <em>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</em>, actress Jessica Chastain portrays Tammy Faye Messner (1942-2007), Pentecostal televangelist partner to first husband Jim Bakker (played by Andrew Garfield). The dramatic ups and downs of Tammy Faye’s life have long been the subject of popular culture interest, one often focused on her physicality. Tammy Faye was famous for her overly done clothing, hair, and makeup, particularly the mascara that would run down her face from tears during their Praise The Lord (PTL) Club television show watched by millions daily. Tammy Faye’s expressive eyes, framed by this thick, black mascara, are the genesis of <em>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</em>.</p>\n<p>I was thrilled to see this movie given my study of the fantastical Heritage USA theme park in Fort Mill, South Carolina, which Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker imagined, constructed, and ran together from 1978 until 1987 when financial and sexual scandals led to the imprisonment of Jim Bakker. (Heritage USA ultimately closed in 1989 due to bankruptcy, following a takeover of the park by Jerry Falwell Sr.) Heritage USA was among the most popular theme parks in the United States in that era, ranking behind only Walt Disney World and Disneyland. Indeed, the Bakkers took the Disney properties as their literal inspiration. Tammy Faye once said, “I have been to many places, but if my Utopia could look any way I wanted it to look, I’d like it to look like Disneyland.” At the Bakkers’ Christian-focused theme park, largely constructed by Roe Messner (later second husband to Tammy Faye), people came for wholesome recreation at the RV campgrounds, a carousel, a miniature train, swimming pools, and tennis courts. The Heritage Island water park thrilled visitors with its 60-foot high Typhoon waterslide, down which the Reverend Jerry Falwell famously descended in a 1987 fundraising stunt. The indoor Main Street shopping mall—unabashedly modeled after Disney’s Main Street—included the Heavenly Fudge Shoppe, Heritage Gift Shoppe, Ye Olde Bookstore, and Noah’s Toy Shoppe, where visitors could buy the Susie Moppet Doll (featured in the movie) that played a recording of Tammy Faye’s voice. The shopping mall also offered the Royal Hair Salon, Tammy Faye-approved makeup, and even lingerie to support “healthy marriages.” The theme park grounds included the television studios for the PTL Club. A more traditional worship space can still be found today in the Upper Room Chapel, a re-creation of the Upper Room in Jerusalem which tradition holds was the site of the Last Supper and reappearance of Jesus to his disciples following his resurrection. (Jessica Chastain as Tammy Faye says in the movie about the Upper Room Chapel: “If you can’t go to Jerusalem, you can go to Heritage USA.”) Heritage USA’s architecture was a pastiche of wide variety of styles: rustic, Victorian, Colonial Revival. While much of Heritage USA has been dismantled, you can find a close version of it in the Morningside Church near Branson, Missouri, where Jim Bakker continues his religious broadcast ministry.</p>\n<p>I argue in my book, <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5322\"><em>Monumental Jesus: Landscapes of Faith &#x26; Doubt in Modern America</em>,</a> that we can best understand Heritage USA within the larger context of the evangelical theme park and the electronic church. The Bakkers were not the only televangelists in the second half of the twentieth century to create theme parks that doubled as the headquarters for their electronic ministries. Pentecostal (and later Methodist) televangelist Oral Roberts created Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma in the 1960s and 1970s (and <em>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</em> features this campus). Much more than a university, the ORU campus served as a stage set for his religious programs. Reverend Robert Schuller’s Garden Grove Community Church in Anaheim, California; Pat Robertson’s Regent University and Christian Broadcasting Network in Virginia Beach, Virginia; and Jerry Falwell Sr.’s Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia were all similarly campuses that located the electronic church in real space and time. The tradition of the evangelical (or more appropriately fundamentalist) theme park persists today in the Ark Encounter and Creation Museum theme parks in Kentucky, constructed by the Young Earth creationist group Answers in Genesis. </p>\n<p>In a scene in <em>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</em> when Jim Bakker and builder Roe Messner are discussing the construction of Heritage USA, Tammy Faye says, “Buildings are miracles.” That these ambitious, expensive, and lavish theme parks paid for with money from “prayer partners” have become a part of the American landscape was indeed a miraculous realization of religious belief, mixed in with American popular culture.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Behind The Eyes of Tammy Faye: Margaret Grubiak on Heritage USA","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"5322","Title":"Monumental Jesus"}],"date":"2021-09-24"},"fields":{"slug":"/behind-the-eyes-of-tammy-faye-margaret-grubiak-on-heritage-usa"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><em>Virginia’s removal of the Robert E. Lee statue from Monument Avenue in Richmond this week <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/08/us/robert-e-lee-statue-virginia.html\">made national news</a>. <strong>Adam H. Domby</strong>, associate professor of history at Auburn University and author of <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5354\">The False Cause: Fraud, Fabrication, and White Supremacy in Confederate Memory</a>, here offers his take on the monument’s history and Lee’s true legacy.</em></p>\n<p>As a statue of Robert E. Lee was lowered to the ground in Richmond, Virginia, on Wednesday, perhaps the most contested Confederate monument had finally met its fate. It was then cut up into multiple pieces to be sent into storage. When I started researching Confederate monuments, I never thought I’d see the day that the Lee statue, the largest Confederate monument besides Stone Mountain, would come down and be cut into pieces. Yet, today Americans have a better understanding of the history of these monuments than they did a decade ago. They understand the historical ties between these monuments and racial oppression.</p>\n<p>As I discuss in <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5354\">The False Cause</a>, Confederate monuments like this one were clearly tied to white supremacy from the time they were erected. As I examine in depth in the book, consciously constructed lies pervaded collective memories of the Civil War from Reconstruction down to the present. Let me take up here one particular myth about Lee that those defending Confederate monuments have pushed recently to show that monuments don’t teach history—rather, they erase the past for present needs. Looking to defend the Lee monument, many neo-Confederates and those advocating to keep monuments like his in place have claimed that Lee facilitated reconciliation after the war. </p>\n<p>In its most recent iteration, this myth claims that Lee did more for reconciliation than perhaps anyone else. Indeed, even Donald Trump issued a statement to this effect after the Lee statue came down. Unfortunately, it included a variety of ahistorical and false pronouncements, including that “except for Gettysburg” Lee would have won the Civil War and that Lee would have defeated the Taliban(!) But the one that stood out to me was that Trump claimed that Lee was “perhaps the greatest unifying force after the war was over.” If this is what monuments like the Lee statue on Richmond’s Monument Avenue taught Trump and other defenders of Confederate statuary, then these monuments clearly failed to teach accurate history. </p>\n<p>Today’s Neo-Confederates often cite Lee as an advocate for racial reconciliation and frequently repeat a story about Lee taking communion with a Black man after the Civil War. But as Andy Hall has <a href=\"https://www.civilwarmonitor.com/blog/fantasizing-lee-as-a-civil-rights-pioneer\">shown</a>, this story is an evolution of an older myth that Lee and other white members of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church had taken communion while ignoring a Black man who had knelt alongside them, thus showing their “superiority” to the African American who had the temerity to try and take communion with them. The Black man was never given communion. Not only is the story likely entirely fabricated, it was first used in 1905 to \"prove\" Lee's devotion to white supremacy and opposition to Black equality and only evolved later to claim the opposite. </p>\n<p>But we don’t need made-up tales to know Lee’s views on race and reconciliation. After the war, Lee remained convinced of white superiority and openly spoke about his views. Pushing for the return of white rule in the South in 1866, he testified to <a href=\"https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/robert-e-lees-testimony-before-congress-february-17-1866/\">Congress</a> that: “I do not think that [the Black man] is as capable of acquiring knowledge as the white man is.” Asked how whites would respond to Blacks being given the vote, he responded that “I think it would excite unfriendly feelings between the two races” before eerily menacing “I cannot pretend to say to what extent it would go, but that would be the result.” Indeed, Lee preferred that Virginia might have a smaller number of congressman than to give the vote to Black men. Lee didn’t stop there, going so far as saying “I think it would be better for Virginia if she could get rid of” the state’s Black population. As some <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-praise-robert-e-lee-s-statue-virginia-shows-how-ncna1278742\">scholars</a> have pointed out, Lee was arguing for ethnic cleansing—not exactly something I would personally deem worthy of celebration.</p>\n<p>After the war Lee was certainly making little to no effort to protect African Americans around him. <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/wlulr-online/vol77/iss1/4/\">While</a> Lee was president of Washington College (now Washington and Lee) his students sexually assaulted Black girls without ramifications and started their own chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. When Lee bothered to address racist harassment he treated it as a minor <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/the-myth-of-the-kindly-general-lee/529038/\">transgression</a>, as a crime less serious than when students threatened to take a holiday. Only if you ignore Black southerners as part of the United States can you imagine that Lee facilitated reconciliation and was a unifying force. </p>\n<p>Ironically, perhaps the one thing Lee did say that fostered any sense of reconciliation was to oppose the erecting of Confederate monuments. In 1869 he <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/robert-e-lee-opposed-confederate-monuments\">wrote</a> that it was better “not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered.” On the surface, Lee seemed to have wished to forget the war, something neo-Confederates now accuse those seeking the removal of monuments of desiring. Although advocates for taking down Confederate monuments love to cite this speech as evidence that Lee opposed statues, in reality it was a matter of timing that drove Lee, not an aversion to celebrating the Confederacy or any evolving views on white supremacy.</p>\n<p>His opposition to monuments in the 1860s was a political calculation as he recognized attempts to celebrate the Confederacy would lead to outrage in the North and might extend Reconstruction. Lee wanted southern whites to regain political control as soon as possible. Yet erecting monuments in 1869 threatened that.  It seems likely his view of monuments might have changed had he lived to see Jim Crow firmly established. Indeed in 1866, he had <a href=\"http://leefamilyarchive.org/papers/letters/transcripts-UVA/v076.html\">written</a>:</p>\n<p><em>As regards the erection of such a monument […] my conviction is, that however grateful it would be to the feelings of the South, the attempt in the present condition of the Country, would have the effect of retarding, instead of accelerating its accomplishment; &#x26; of continuing, if not adding to, the difficulties under which the Southern people labour. All I think that can now be done, is to aid our noble &#x26; generous women in their efforts to protect the graves &#x26; mark the last resting places of those who have fallen, &#x26; wait for better times.</em></p>\n<p>That last line especially is, to me, indicative of his true feelings. By “wait for better times” Lee meant that when white southerners (the only group Lee included in “the southern people”) were no longer under Reconstruction and occupation by U.S. Army troops (what Lee meant by the “present difficulties”), then monuments would be appropriate. </p>\n<p>Even Lee’s opposition to monuments was about defending white supremacy. At some level Lee understood that monuments seek to demonstrate who controls public spaces; erecting them too early would raise the ire of those who opposed the return to power of former Confederates. Lee died in 1870, never seeing the disenfranchisement of Black southerners or the rise of Jim Crow (Lee’s “better times”) that led to the subsequent widespread erection of Confederate monument. </p>\n<p>Monuments do not teach history. Indeed, monuments celebrating Lee seem to have obscured the past rather than informed the public. They hide the fact that Lee committed <a href=\"https://blogs.chapman.edu/wilkinson/2021/04/28/robert-e-lee-and-me-a-conversation-with-ty-seidule/\">treason</a>, took up arms against the United States Army in an effort to create a slaveholders republic, and at times even that he was defeated. Lee’s army <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Black_Flag_Over_Dixie/WRC9QOdYDYcC?hl=en&#x26;gbpv=1&#x26;pg=PA203&#x26;printsec=frontcover\">committed war crimes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/08/we-have-received-provocation-enough/61276/\">enslaved free people</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ande/learn/historyculture/grant-and-the-prisoner-exchange.htm\">refused to treat Black prisoners as POWs</a>. Monuments help hide these facts by telling us that this is a man worthy of looking up to. </p>\n<p>Monuments teach people who to admire. Until the removal of Lee’s statue this week, viewers were forced to literally look up to him on Monument Avenue. But was the real man worthy of the monument he received? Did he represent the city of Richmond’s values in the twenty-first century? The statue certainly represented the values of those who put up the monument <a href=\"https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/museum-curator-robert-e-lee-statue-was-a-segregation-selling-point?_amp=true\">as part of residential development</a> that banned African Americans from buying houses.  </p>\n<p>Monuments seek to silence the voices of those men and women whom Lee enslaved, who recalled him as an especially cruel and harsh oppressor who separated families. The truth about who Lee was as a man (flawed, racist, and loser—at least when it came to the Civil War) is erased by monuments that present him as perfect. It is hardly surprising that defenders of these monuments frequently struggle to identify the root causes of the war they celebrate. </p>\n<p>The Lost Cause has long distorted the past in an effort to uphold white supremacy, but for just as long <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HilaryGreen77/status/1435597634564235264\">others have opposed this erasure of the past</a>. As I note in my book, in 1929 while reporting on how former Confederates were trying to rewrite history, a Black journalist observed that “the lost cause was not only lost but misguided and God-forsaken.” Yet monuments like the Lee statue in Richmond sought to suppress any viewpoints that pushed back against the Lost Cause’s narrative of history, a narrative premised upon lies and white supremacy. Who knows? Perhaps fewer monuments venerating this Confederate general will lead to a more accurate assessment of the man and his cause.</p>\n<p><em>For more on the real Robert E.

What inspired you to produce this book?</em> </p>\n<p>​This volume arose from a conference that we organized in Galway and Dublin in the spring of 2017. That meeting intended to bring together scholars from the United States and beyond with colleagues in Ireland to consider the ways in which the insights offered by Irish history might challenge and inform our understanding of colonization, imperialism, and revolution in North America. It was the inaugural meeting of a project we have dubbed the Revolutionary Age, and we're pleased that this is the inaugural volume in <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/2020/07/14/uva-press-announces-new-series-revolutionary-age\">our series of the same name with UVA Press</a>.</p>\n<p><em>2. What did you learn and what are you hoping readers will learn from your book?</em> </p>\n<p>​We're hoping that readers will see the continuities and connections between Ireland and America during the latter part of the eighteenth century as people in both places confronted imperialism and mounted their own challenges to it. The differences between the two places are instructive, too, as race was the crucial line of demarcation in America while religion played that role in Ireland. </p>\n<p><em>3. What surprised you the most in the process of editing your book?</em> </p>\n<p>Patrick and I both have lot of experience with editing scholarly collections. I was pleased and surprised that things went as smoothly as they did. Our contributors were prompt and responsive to editorial suggestions, and colleagues at the University of Notre Dame (which provided crucial support for the project) and at UVA Press were delightful to work with. In the past when I've finished a big editorial project I've said, \"Never again!\" That wasn't the case with this project.</p>\n<p><em>4. What’s your favorite anecdote from your book?</em> </p>\n<p>Getting colleagues out of their comfort zones (admittedly in a very convivial place) facilitated lively scholarly exchanges that were memorable. We experienced some wonderful hospitality and saw some wonderful places: from Kylemore Abbey in Galway to Daniel O'Connell's home. It was a thrill to see the Book of Kells in the Trinity College Library. I particularly remember engaging in a lively discussion in a pub with Tim Breen and Gordon Wood about our favorite writers of detective and crime fiction. Patricia Highsmith, Raymond Chandler, and Michael Connelly figured prominently.</p>\n<p><em>5. What’s next?</em> </p>\n<p> Patrick and I will continue working with Nadine on the Revolutionary Age series. We're very excited that a number of very interesting volumes are in the works. I'm completing a book on the relationship between George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and Patrick, who will be the Harmsworth Professor at Oxford during the 2021/22 academic year, is completing a broad overview of the Age of Revolution.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"SHEAR 2021: A Q&A with Frank Cogliano","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"5481","Title":"Ireland and America"}],"date":"2021-07-15"},"fields":{"slug":"/shear-2021-a-q-a-with-frank-cogliano"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>We share in mourning the loss of William \"Bill\" Robertson, the first African American to serve as an aide to a Virginia governor. He subsequently served in five presidential administrations. Before his passing, Robertson also was finishing work on his memoir LIFTING EVERY VOICE: <em>My Journey from Segregated Roanoke to the Corridors of Power,</em> to be published in the Spring of 2022.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://roanoke.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-former-roanoker-bill-robertson-made-history-in-virginia/article_62e9ad10-d515-11eb-a7ed-8f38e425f0fa.html\">The Roanoke Times</a></em> offers a remembrance: </p>\n<p>\"One day in September 1968, the principal of Roanoke’s Hurt Park Elementary School took a phone call from a prominent lawyer in town. Linwood Holton asked if he could come pay a visit. Naturally, Bill Robertson said yes. It turned out that Holton’s visit had nothing to do with education. Holton said he was planning to run for governor the following year and asked Robertson to run for the House of Delegates.</p>\n<p>\"In some ways, Robertson was a prime candidate for politics. He was well-known educator, active in civic affairs with service on multiple boards. What made Holton’s approach unusual was two things: Robertson was a Democrat. He also was Black. Robertson demurred. He thought Holton’s approach was simply a publicity trick. The presidential campaign was on and Robertson had no taste for Richard Nixon. Holton said that was fine, that Robertson could sit out the presidential campaign. Instead, Holton explained his real aim: He wanted to take down the segregationist Byrd Machine that ruled Virginia. He planned to run for governor the following year and wanted to run with a biracial ticket to usher Virginia into a new era. After hearing Holton’s impassioned plea, Robertson was persuaded. He waited until after the election, switched parties and ran the following year for a House seat in November 1969.</p>\n<p>\"Holton won but Robertson lost — just not for long. Three days after the election, Holton called Robertson and asked him to serve on his gubernatorial staff. Holton’s governorship looms large in Virginia history. He was the first Republican governor since Reconstruction and his victory represented a civil rights breakthrough in a state that had been ruled by segregationist Democrats. In his inaugural address, Holton famously declared “the era of defiance is behind us.” And, as every account of Holton’s governorship points out, he was the first governor to put a Black adviser on his staff. That adviser was Robertson, who died Tuesday at age 88 from heart failure at his home in Maryland.</p>\n<p>\"Robertson’s appointment made statewide headlines at the time. More than a half-century later, when we’ve had a Black president, a Black governor, two Black lieutenant governors, and Black politicians in key positions in the General Assembly, it’s hard to fathom just how groundbreaking the appointment of a single Black staffer was back in 1969.</p>\n<p>\"Robertson became something of a celebrity — an in-demand speaker across the state by both Black and white groups alike. As Robertson wrote in his memoir, 'there had never been anyone like me in state government.' Alas, Robertson did not live to see that memoir published. 'Lifting Every Voice: My Journey from Segregated Roanoke to the Corridors of Power' is scheduled to be published in February 2022 by the University of Virginia Press.</p>\n<p>\"The memoir — co-authored with Becky Hatcher Crabtree — poignantly offers insight into an era that many today don’t fully understand.\"</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Robertson's memoir chronicles nearly ninety years of Black history in Virginia and the United States. His life's story and activism illuminate the entrenched white supremacy in every corner of Virginia’s government and the nitty-gritty work that went into dismantling it. It serves as a strong reminder, too, that the Civil Rights protests of the 1960s marked the beginning of redressing state-sanctioned discrimination, not the end. Robertson's longtime work with the Jaycees on helping build a camp for children with mental disabilities is likewise a stark reminder of how slow Virginia was to move on mental health issues. </p>\n<p>Overall, Robertson's book and his life serve as a rallying cry for continued activism to bring about justice and equity for all, a point that Woody Holton makes in his tribute to Robertson in <em>The Richmond Times-Dispatch,</em> which you can read <a href=\"https://richmond.com/opinion/columnists/woody-holton-column-an-optimist-moves-on/article_0e466a7e-c586-5163-9ceb-2cb88c6bc6b7.html\">here.</a></p>\n<p>Photo credit: \"Photo by John Frischkorn, VA Department of Highways.

My book, <em><a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5438\">Sapphic Crossings: Cross-Dressing Women in Eighteenth-Century British Literature</a></em> (UVA Press, 2021), looks at the lesbian, transgender and nonbinary histories that many people today haven’t heard of—yet.</p>\n<p>Many people associate Pride celebrations with parades, rainbow gear, and parties, and for many people, Pride is associated primarily with gays and lesbians. In fact, sometimes Pride is called “Gay Pride.” What many do not know is that the Stonewall Riots that happened at the end of June 1969—the reason why Pride month is the month of June—were instigated by long-time transgender activists of color, including Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, both of whom worked to promote LGBTQ rights for many years before and after the riots.</p>\n<p>Transgender and gay history are intertwined with one another, even if many people don’t always think about them that way. But gender and sexuality are difficult to extricate from one another. After all, gay couples are defined as gay because they are two people of the same gender. Despite the close connections between these categories, they are often talked about, thought about, and written about as separate.</p>\n<p>When it comes to historical research into the lives of people who may or may not have been gay or bisexual or transgender, it becomes even harder to label anyone because we can’t go back in time to ask them how they thought of their gender identity or sexual orientation—and how they felt about those things might not easily align with the language that we use today. As any historian of sexuality will tell you, people did not always think of their sexuality as a part of their identity, like their gender, class, or nationality, while gendered categories of existence varied from culture to culture and across time and place.</p>\n<p>And yet, I believe it is extremely important to look into the past to find traces of LGBTQ people—not to “label” people of the past, but rather to understand the role of LGBTQ people and identities in the past and today as part of <em>mainstream</em> culture, rather than on the peripheries. In my book, I consider people like Mary/George Hamilton, whose story was salaciously retold in an extremely fictionalized manner by major eighteenth-century author Henry Fielding, author of <em>Tom Jones</em> and many other novels and plays.</p>\n<p>This fictionalized story, published anonymously as <em>The Female Husband</em>, fascinated eighteenth-century readers, and was widely available throughout Britain from its publication in 1746 and into the nineteenth century. The narrative presents Hamilton as a person assigned female at birth, seduced by a lesbian Methodist, who finally ran away from home in men’s clothing and went on to seduce—and marry—several women in England before being apprehended and charged with fraud and vagrancy by the local courts.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, Hamilton was outed for being <em>too good</em> in bed—the dildo they used was apparently “unrealistic”…not that Hamilton’s wife was complaining! </p>\n<p>Hamilton’s dressing in men’s clothing and using a man’s name places them squarely in the realm of transgender history. And yet, for the narrator of the text, it is Hamilton’s desires for women that are problematic—placing their narrative into the realm of proto-lesbian history.</p>\n<p>Hamilton’s case demonstrates how difficult it can be to “label” people of the past. Was Hamilton gender fluid? Transgender? Genderqueer? Butch lesbian? In my book, I move beyond such questions to consider ones that I believe are more important, such as: why was this story so popular for eighteenth-century readers? How is it that eighteenth-century readers would have been familiar with a dildo and what does that familiarity tell us about sexual practices at the time? And why was transgender representation so crucial for representing same-sex female desires in the eighteenth century?</p>\n<p>The intertwined history of transgender identity and gay and lesbian identity needs to be acknowledged.  Just like the history of Pride month, the longer history of LGBTQ identities is one made up of many intertwined strands. I’m proud to contribute to excavating and analyzing that history in my book, primarily by looking at what popular literary texts can tell us about how lesbian desires and trans embodiments were represented in narrative.</p>\n<p>Ula Klein is Director of Women’s and Gender Studies at the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh and author of <em><a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5438\">Sapphic Crossings: Cross-Dressing Women in Eighteenth-Century British Literature</a>.</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Celebrating Pride Month: An Essay by Ula Klein, Author of Sapphic Crossings","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"5438","Title":"Sapphic Crossings"}],"date":"2021-06-15"},"fields":{"slug":"/celebrating-pride-month-an-essay-by-ula-klein-author-of-sapphic-crossings"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>“I hate the myth of Hemingway. And the reason I hate the myth of Hemingway: It obscures the man. And the man is much more interesting than the myth.” So says Michael Katakis, the manager of the Hemingway estate, toward the very beginning of Ken Burns’s and Lynn Novick’s (excellent) recent documentary, <em>Hemingway</em>, on PBS. It is hard to imagine a more incomprehending attitude toward Hemingway, for whom – as <em>Hemingway</em> shows itself to know perfectly well throughout – the “man” and the “myth” are entirely entwined.</p>\n<p>One wonders if Katakis’s comments are given such prominence at the beginning of <em>Hemingway</em> in order to underscore, by ironic contrast, the inextricability of the man and myth in Hemingway’s career. (Burns is fond of this sort of irony – as when, at the very beginning of <em>Vietnam</em>, the narrator explains that the war “was begun in good faith, by decent people.”) It may not always be fruitless to pursue a distinction between biographical person and authorial persona; but in the case of Hemingway – as in the case of Oscar Wilde, his most obvious predecessor in literary celebrity – it is a fool’s errand.</p>\n<p>This does not mean that Hemingway was inauthentic. Like Jean Rhys in his own time, like William Burroughs after him, Hemingway went to unbearable places for art. This courage was also a facet of his popular success. His quest was real. But it needed to signify its bravery and its extremity for a large readership who could derive a popular existentialism from it.</p>\n<p>Unlike Rhys or Burroughs, Hemingway’s experiments with limits had the authorization of an entire war-torn, war-obsessed culture. War for Hemingway offered a solution to a problem whose terms would only be clear after him: How can a writer go out <em>all the way</em> without alienating a mass audience – without, like Burroughs, becoming a resuscitated Baudelaire, a “countercultural” writer? Hemingway welded the needs of the official culture for an account of its wars – including a celebration of the patriotic values of courage, heroism, and so on – to a decadent poetics of extreme experience it might otherwise have been impossible to make mainstream.</p>\n<p>Hemingway himself was entirely aware of his substitution of the experience of war for the nineteenth-century decadents’ emphasis on experiential extremes associated with pathology. He flagged this affiliation in <em>The Green Hills of Africa</em>, when he described “what a great advantage an experience of war is to a writer…Those writers who had not seen it were always very jealous and tried to make it seem unimportant, or abnormal, or a disease as a subject, while really, it was just something quite irreplaceable that they had missed.” </p>\n<p><em>Green Hills of Africa</em> is not about war but about hunting. Hemingway was quite transparent about the “decadent” appeal he found in the ritualized killing of animals in hunting and in the bullfight. Modern bullfighting, he says, is “decadent in every way,” and “like most decadent things…reaches its fullest flower at its rottenest point, which is at present.”  For Hemingway, “decadence” as such founds its “fullest flower” in <em>Garden of Eden</em> – his unfinished novel of androgyny.</p>\n<p><em>Hemingway</em> introduces its subject’s interest in androgyny toward its beginning. The theme is mentioned occasionally throughout, but it is never developed. One would not suspect from the evidence of the film that the 1986 publication of <em>Garden of Eden</em> occasioned a comprehensive reassessment of Hemingway’s treatment of gender and sex. That’s a perfectly defensible choice. After all, <em>Garden of Eden</em> was not at all a part of Hemingway’s reception in his lifetime. It was published long after its author’s death, in a highly edited and condensed form and without his oversight or approval. For all of these reasons, it can seem in some sense irrelevant to Hemingway’s importance.</p>\n<p><em>The Garden of Eden</em> borrows its themes of decadent androgyny and sexual role-reversal from the French, especially from Gautier’s 1834 novel <em>Mademoiselle de Maupin</em>, as Nancy Comley and Robert Scholes pointed out in their groundbreaking 1996 <em>Hemingway’s Genders</em>. As published, the novel depicts a love triangle encompassing a young writer, David Bourne, his wife, Catherine, and their new friend Marita, whom they meet in Europe. David and Catherine’s relationship involves androgynous identity mergers (they cut their hair to resemble one another) and sexual role reversals (David is anally penetrated by Catherine). In this novel, the hermaphrodite becomes a figure for the self-fertilizing creativity of the artist.</p>\n<p>This project entails an explicitly critical treatment of the Hemingway worldview, that external gaze whereby psychic depths are indicated only by indirection. David, as a writer, consciously resists decadent self-probing. This is an irony of literary genre; refusing self-insight, he is somehow stuck in the wrong kind of novel. For David, writing requires perceptiveness about others, but it eschews any too-conscious investigations of oneself. “I’m good on other people and on technical things…nobody knows about himself when he is really involved. It would be shameful.” David’s androgyny in <em>Garden of Eden</em> represents the risk of “knowing about himself,” a risk which it is difficult, after reading that novel, not to see anxiously addressed across all of Hemingway’s earlier work.</p>\n<p>The hazard of interpretive overreach is severe. Meryl Altman puts it best when she describes the temptation to take <em>Garden of Eden</em> as “the magic decoder ring” of Hemingway’s oeuvre: “The danger is that retrospective blurring can lead to over-reading, and misreading” the books that came before it.</p>\n<p>But since <em>Hemingway</em> is a biography above all, Burns’s and Novick’s failure to address <em>Garden of Eden</em> more than in passing seems a bit perverse. More than any other modernist, Hemingway’s fiction rewards a biographical hermeneutic – not because “man” and “myth” are distinguishable, but because they are not. Whether you want to know about Hemingway or “Hemingway,” you can hardly do better than to read <em>Garden of Eden</em>, a text whose failure to be completed is a sign of its biographical potency and of the fraught psychosexual ingredients of the “myth.” The risk of a text this psychologically revealing is that it can damage the work that preceded it – not because it is inferior but because it imposes an interpretation that those works, in their assiduous artistry, refused to countenance: indeed, censored. </p>\n<p>In the novels published during his lifetime, androgynous interiority is an absence, a blank center around which to spin the fantasy of the macho Hemingway hero. But <em>The Garden of Eden</em> would liberate Hemingway to resolve his ambivalence, to elevate the kernel of an interiority he feared as pathological (as “abnormal, or a disease as a subject,” as he put it of war) to the plane of art. Hemingway could not, in his lifetime, bring himself to finish or to publish <em>Garden of Eden</em>, though the manuscript would grow to over two thousand pages: a measure of both the power of his phobia and the depth of his obsession.</p>\n<p><em>Len Gutkin is a senior editor at</em> The Chronicle Review <em>and the author of</em> <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5245\">Dandyism: Forming Fiction from Modernism to the Present </a><em>(UVA, 2020), from which some of this essay is adapted.</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hemingway, The Garden of Eden, and Authenticity: A Post by Len Gutkin","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"5245","Title":"Dandyism"}],"date":"2021-06-11"},"fields":{"slug":"/hemingway-the-garden-of-eden-and-authenticity-a-post-by-len-gutkin"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><a href=\"/rotunda\">Rotunda</a>, UVA Press's digital imprint, is seeking feedback on the user experience of its American History Collection.

We asked Susan Herrington, a personal friend of Oberlander's and author of the biography <em><a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/4295\">Cornelia Hahn Oberlander: Making the Modern Landscape</a></em> to share her remembrances, which we offer below. </p>\n<p>When Cornelia Hahn Oberlander passed away on May 22, 2021, we lost an amazing landscape architect and my good friend. I wrote <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/4295\"><em>Cornelia Hahn Oberlander: Making the Modern Landscape</em>,</a> which was published by the University of Virginia Press in 2013. I remember telling Boyd Zenner, the architecture and landscape acquisition editor for the press at the time, about the book in 2008. She immediately saw the potential and encouraged me to write a prospectus, which was thankfully accepted. The book was a real highlight for Cornelia, and it helped spread the word about her extraordinary life and her groundbreaking work.</p>\n<p>At first I think Cornelia thought she was going to dictate the narrative to me, but I explained to her that I was going to interpret her life and work for the book, and that I hoped she would enjoy it. Thankfully, she did, and she was very generous with her time and her knowledge. With support from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada, The Canada Council for the Arts, and the Graham Foundation, I was able to hire students and photographers, and visited fourteen different archives across North America. I conducted formal interviews with Cornelia and had many informal conversations with her as well, and we visited many of her landscapes together. If she forgot a detail, she would say, “Susan, consult The Google.”</p>\n<p>Cornelia also shared with me numerous personal stories, documents, and photos. Her most poignant accounts involved her fleeing from Nazi Germany with her mother and sister. Then there was the problem at that less-enlightened moment—that Cornelia wanted to become a modern landscape architect­—and she was a woman. While she had numerous run-ins with her professors as a student at Harvard, as well as her bosses at Skidmore, Owings &#x26; Merrill, she also had some funny stories. When she worked for Mayer &#x26; Whittlesey in New York, she was asked to go to the drafting store and pick up some “vanishing points.”</p>\n<p>When the book was finished I was able to secure funding from the Canada Council for the Arts for a book tour. We covered twelve different cities (eleven in North America, one in Sweden) between 2014 and 2015. Because Cornelia accompanied me, I didn’t do the typical book reading. Instead I showed slides to Cornelia in front of a live audience and she spoke to the images. The presentation was different for each event, we never rehearsed, and I had absolutely no idea what she was going to say! It could be a hilarious anecdote, practical advice, or a heartfelt reminiscence of her life with Peter Oberlander (1922–2008).</p>\n<p>When we were touring around the various cities, she had oodles of friends and admirers at every stop. There were often dinners and parties associated with the book talks. She liked to introduce me to people as “my author,” which at the time I thought was a strange way to introduce someone. But now it’s something I fondly remember. I could not have picked a better person to write about than Cornelia Hahn Oberlander, or a better friend for these road trips, enlivened by her views of her life and her wonderful work.</p>\n<p>Susan Herrington</p>\n<p><em>Photo caption: Cornelia Hahn Oberlander, with the published account of her life and work, 2014</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mourning the Passing of Cornelia Hahn Oberlander: A Tribute by Susan Herrington","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"4295","Title":"Cornelia Hahn Oberlander"}],"date":"2021-05-08"},"fields":{"slug":"/mourning-the-passing-of-cornelia-hahn-oberlander-a-tribute-by-susan-herrington"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>UVA Press is proud to be publishing the memoir of one of America's great public servants, former Virginia Governor and Senator Chuck Robb. <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5679\">IN THE ARENA: A Memoir of Love, War, and Politics</a> moves from a White House wedding to the trenches of Vietnam to the halls of power in Washington D.C. to create a portrait of a man and an era that were innovative, refreshingly less partisan, and impactful on us to this day. \"In my lifetime,\" President Bill Clinton writes in his foreword, \"few have served our country as ably and honorably as Chuck Robb.\"</p>\n<p>Governor Robb will be taking part in a series of online author events.

Butler, Ph.D., Editorial Fellow at UVA Press</p>\n<p>April 12, 2021 marks 160 years to the day since the firing on Fort Sumter, the opening salvo of the Civil War. It can be tempting to think of that stretch of time as a massive gulf, practically unbridgeable—at least in the timeline of American history. But consider this: we are now exactly as far removed from the attack on Pearl Harbor, eighty years ago, as Pearl Harbor was from the bombardment of Fort Sumter. Eighty years (four score, if you will) before that, George Washington accepted the surrender of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown. Those three leaps are all it takes to embrace the entirety of the United States’ existence. Scholars continue to grapple with and offer new assessments of the Civil War not only because it remains so persistently, often painfully, relevant to our lives (think of the Confederate flags brandished on January 6), but because it all happened not so long ago. We are still coming to terms with it, still gaining the temporal distance necessary to attain new perspectives and to produce critical reevaluations of the coming of the war, the course of the war itself, and the nature of the peace established in its wake. Three books published in 2020 by the University of Virginia Press have made valuable contributions to this ongoing conversation.</p>\n<p>Newest Born of Nations: European Nationalist Movements and the Making of the Confederacy, by Ann L. Tucker, explores the ways that white southerners’ observation of nationalist revolutions and efforts at state formation across the Atlantic helped them lay the philosophical groundwork of their own stab for independence in North America. Future Confederates did not hatch their separatist schemes in a vacuum. As Tucker demonstrates, practically every political question they considered utilized an international perspective as a frame of reference – emphasizing their similarity or difference from a perceived European counterpart – to help situate themselves ideologically. For many white southerners, appreciation of the liberal impulses of European nationalist movements was tempered by their fundamental conservatism that emphasized the desirability of a firm social hierarchy. They approved of republicanism, less so of “rank” democracy, which they worried could easily lead to anarchy. When the war came, Tucker finds, their self-conception received something of a shock, especially when Italian nationalist icon Giuseppe Garibaldi rejected their claims to nationhood and declared his support for the Union.</p>\n<p>Adrian Brettle’s Colossal Ambitions: Confederate Planning for a Post-Civil War World shows how Confederates’ wartime visions for what would follow their victory, which they continued to cherish right up to the spring of 1865, provides key insight into what they considered their raison d’être. Brettle’s work also constitutes a further nail in the coffin of the Lost Cause historiographical narrative. He shows that, rather than modestly wanting to be left alone, expansion represented the watchword of Confederates’ plan for the future. Their territorial ambitions, which they sustained well into the war – far past the point when some continue to contend that they “knew” the war to be lost – helps push back against a misleading teleological framing of the conflict. Confederates also actively sought to foster divisions within the remaining Union states. In order to maintain their independence and wealth in the imagined post-war environment, Confederates hoped to contribute to the further breakup of the Union in order that they might dominate the smaller confederations that would emerge. None of this, as Brettle makes clear, corresponds to the thinking of a people who felt their cause to be lost.</p>\n<p>Finally, Adam Domby’s The False Cause: Fraud, Fabrication, and White Supremacy in Confederate Memory examines the ways that such a narrative – of valiant efforts against hopeless odds – could gain such widespread cultural purchase. The answer, he argues, is simple: by lying. The solidarity of the nineteenth-century white South, one willing to endure tremendous sacrifice and loss as a matter of pure principle, appears on closer examination as simply a myth, cultivated by individuals with the express political and social goal of maintaining white supremacy and Jim Crow. Pensions made available to Confederate veterans gave men with even the most tenuous claim to service an incentive to exaggerate their commitment to the cause, and functioned as a form of political patronage. Likewise, the number of UNC alumni purported to have fought for the Confederacy grew year after year until it reached a literally impossible figure, one that surpassed the number of UNC’s living graduates. The descendants of the Civil War generation displayed a greater commitment to the Confederacy than its contemporaries did.</p>\n<p>As Domby’s work directly addresses, the struggle to define Civil War memory remains continual and contingent. No such thing as the final word on any given subject can ever truly exist in the study of history. And just as today’s date reminds us that only two lifetimes separate us from Fort Sumter and the start of the war, so these three books remind us to keep looking, keep thinking, and keep reading, because the dust has only begun to settle.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"In Remembrance of the Firing on Fort Sumter","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"5194","Title":"Colossal Ambitions"},{"jsonId":"5354","Title":"The False Cause"},{"jsonId":"5042","Title":"Newest Born of Nations"}],"date":"2021-04-12"},"fields":{"slug":"/in-remembrance-of-the-firing-on-fort-sumter"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><strong>February 2021; Charlottesville, VA:</strong> The University of Virginia Press is pleased to announce “The Black Soldier in War and Society: New Narratives and Critical Perspectives,” a new series for innovative scholarship on the Black military experience to highlight the diverse and complex experiences of African-descended people and to explore the implications of their participation in war.</p>\n<p>“We are delighted to welcome this important series to UVA Press,” said the Press’s director, Suzanne Morse Moomaw. “The books in it will highlight the enormous contributions of Black soldiers in protecting our freedoms over the centuries but also the racist challenges they faced in the military and in their communities back home.”</p>\n<p>Le’Trice Donaldson, Holly Pinheiro Jr., and george white jr. conceived of this series to bring to scholarly audiences as well as a wide reading public a robust slate of high-quality books written by junior and veteran scholars who share their passion for exploring the intersectionality of the Black military experience.

Did rank and file, poor white southerners share these visions of expansion and prosperity?</em> </p>\n<p>[AB]: The non-slaveholding majority came to believe that there would be a better life for them to be had in the future Confederacy. Confederates used arguments about economics, national policy, and the worsening conditions under a Lincoln administration to support their case. Two factors would raise the purchasing power of the poorest white southerner. First, there were lower prices for imported goods to be had in a nation dedicated to free trade. Second, planners believed that Confederates would get more money for their crops. Confederates believed that the South as an independent nation would be in a position to negotiate preferential terms of trade because Britain and other countries would now recognize the importance of the southern market (obscured before by being in the Union) and hence be prepared to pay more. If these promises of increased prosperity were not sufficient on their own, Confederate leaders offered the antebellum expansionist argument that only the acquisition of new lands would enable non-slaveholders to become slaveholders at one point in the future. During the war, there were debates about Confederate homesteads for veterans (land along with an enslaved person or family) to spread slaveownership and the presumed benefits of living in a slaveholding society to more white southerners. Finally, elites thought that the election of Abraham Lincoln and the revolutionary rule of the northern mob would lead to a panic, banking crisis, and hard times. This gloomy prospect would be intensified by the Lincoln administration’s policies designed to undermine the stability of southern society, from stopping the expansion of slavery to dissemination of abolitionist propaganda to patronage appointments whose holders would try to undermine southern class solidarity.</p>\n<p>[CB]: <em>Why did Confederates think other countries and people (esp. Northerners and the British) adopted such a hypocritical posture as compared to their own clear-eyedness when it came to coerced labor?</em> </p>\n<p>[AB]: Confederates believed that the most militant abolitionists in New England and Britain were also the biggest indirect customers of slavery. After southern independence, those who supported emancipation and opposed the expansion of slavery would be revealed to be individuals who were simply jealous of the superiority of that labor system. Only slavery, Confederates believed, was both efficient and benevolent for the workers of the new age. All other labor systems were not only inferior, but were also becoming more like slavery everyday as wages fell and hours increased in the factories in the North, contracts became more onerous, and the temptation to resort to Chinese and Indian (i.e. from India) sources of labor increased. As proof of the superiority of slavery, Confederate propagandists, such as James D. B. DeBow, repeatedly pointed to the example of the decline of the sugar industry in both Haiti and the British Caribbean as evidence that after emancipation, productivity fell. Africans would only work on the sugar plantations under conditions of slavery. Confederates noted that both alleged efforts to import Chinese laborers into the British West Indies and U.S. plans to colonize ‘trained’ freedpeople from the South in Haiti were efforts to end this stagnation. Of course Confederate commentators failed to mention that the real reason for the decline of the sugar industry in Jamaica, Barbados, and the other islands of the British West Indies, was not emancipation, but instead the decision of the British Government itself to embrace free trade in 1846.</p>\n<p>[CB]: <em>Free trade, in your book, appears absolutely central to the Confederate worldview. Did Confederates ascribe greater influence to economic/financial inducements than their contemporaries, again Northerners or the British? They seemed so certain it would reliably affect future behavior.</em></p>\n<p>I think the answer to this question is more about understanding slavery as the bedrock of the southern social system. Confederates considered the stability of southern society to be superior to that of both the North and Europe. Lincoln’s election was apparent proof that the Union had succumbed to mob democracy, which was their term for the tyranny of the majority, which would in time lead to social revolution and the overthrow of the propertied classes by landless laborers. Meanwhile, the conditions were even more volatile in Europe, where aristocratic regimes, including in Britain, faced increasing threats of insurrection from the disenfranchised working classes demanding the vote. Works by scholars of the Civil War Era, including Andre Fleche, Don Doyle, and Ann Tucker, have taught us much about the ideological connections between the European Revolutions of 1848 and the United States. Confederates believed that refugees from Europe, together with immigrants fleeing repressive British ‘colonial’ rule in Ireland, brought revolutionary ideas with them. These arrivals, swelling the numbers of so called ‘wage-slaves’ in the new factories of the industrial revolution, only intensified the threat posed to representative democracy in the North. This state of affairs explained, for Confederates, the appeal of bribes from the slavepower to northerners and the British. Any commercial deal that increased the reliability and quantity of supply of necessities from Confederate producers would appeal to beleaguered regimes facing revolution. Also, as God’s chosen people, evangelical Confederates took seriously their mission to spread world peace and uplift the poor by clothing them with textiles made from southern cotton and so bring them toward a Christian, civilized future. Therefore, these inducements Confederates offered to their customers would both help restore stability to regimes threatened by class cleavage and, at the same time, reinforce a sense of mission so important to a new nation in the world.</p>\n<p>[CB]: <em>How do you see your work in relation to that of Walter Johnson, especially</em> River of Dark Dreams*?*</p>\n<p>[AB]: My book certainly connects with key themes in studies by Johnson, Edward Baptist, Sven Beckert, and other scholars, who argue that slavery drove capitalism, empire, and U.S. expansion in the nineteenth century. Confederates understood slavery to be modern and expanding and expected the institution to return to the Caribbean and spread across Central and South America under their auspices. However, I show that Confederates expected that their independence and expansion would take the world and the global economy in a different direction to the one that scholars of capitalism seek to understand and explain. Confederates sought to replace competition and the development of national economies, increasingly protected by tariff walls, with a new era of international cooperation and collaboration. They hoped to lead the major economies of the world toward a system of comparative advantage; by focusing on a few select activities in which a nation had a particular advantage, each nation would become increasingly interdependent on other countries. This suited Confederate self-interest for it was only in this kind of economic system that slavery’s survival would be guaranteed. Above all, Confederate planners thought that an interdependent world offered the best chance for a sustained period of peace, one in which slavery would be able to eventually revive and expand, undisturbed by rival powers in the Confederate zone of influence in Central and South America. A chilling vision indeed.</p>\n<p>[CB]: <em>How does your work relate to the Lost Cause memory of the Civil War, so much in the news recently with debates on the future of Confederate monuments, and renaming of schools and military bases across the South that honored Confederate generals?</em></p>\n<p>[AB]: The Lost Cause memory of the Civil War is a postwar invention. My book shows how hard and how long Confederates continued to believe in an independent future for themselves, even as they, by the last year of the war, also had to increasingly accommodate themselves to the reality of Union power. After all, the noted early propagandist of the Lost Cause, Edward Alfred Pollard, as late as February 1865 published a pamphlet arguing that the Union would now let the South go as it was sufficiently strong enough to be a great power without it. Until April 1865, these individuals remained adamant that there would come a time when the fighting would stop and negotiations between the sections would resume as if the war had never happened. This expected postwar settlement, to be hammered out in conventions and by commissions, meant compromises that qualified the meaning of independence for Confederates, but it would also preserve slavery.  Confederates debated the agenda items to be discussed. Most striking of all, Confederates did not believe that their future nation would become like Prussia, organized around celebrating the deeds of its army; instead they looked forward to postwar demobilization, and they anticipated that it would be the navy that would grow to be the symbol of the nation, given the need to protect a large merchant marine. At times, Confederate planners expected that with the reestablishment of peace a modern, even progressive, nation might emerge, one based on slavery and expanding into new lands and new commodities. This vision is strikingly different to the Lost Cause commemoration of a patriarchal Old South and heroes of the Army of Northern Virginia. “Confederate Ambitions: Flawed Visions for a New Nation,” the title of the UVA Nau Center for Civil War History’s panel at the 2021 Festival of the Book, demonstrates that <em>Colossal Ambitions</em> adds to the debate on whether there was a Confederate nation. My conclusion is that there was such a nation but the thinking varied, was often vague, and was even contradictory to the point of qualifying what it means to be an independent nation state.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Interview with Dr. Adrian Brettle, author of COLOSSAL AMBITIONS: Confederate Planning for a Post-Civil War World","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"5194","Title":"Colossal Ambitions"}],"date":"2021-02-12"},"fields":{"slug":"/interview-with-dr-adrian-brettle-author-of-colossal-ambitions-confederate-planning-for-a-post-civil-war-world"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>In celebration of Black History Month, we are pleased to offer this selection from the introduction of Dr. Johnetta Cole's new book<a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5628\"> RACISM IN AMERICAN PUBLIC LIFE: A Call to Action. </a></p>\n<p>As I was completing my final revisions for this book, two monumental events occurred in the United States. The first was the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most deadly health crisis since the flu pandemic of 1918. The second was the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, and the subsequent demonstrations that in June alone involved as many as 26 million people nationwide, with more than 40 percent of U.S. counties participating in the protests.</p>\n<p>The two pandemics are connected in the sense that the coronavirus outbreak has exposed the systemic racial and economic inequality that continues to afflict our nation. I refer to both the current health crisis and this period of racial turmoil as pandemics because each has spread across our nation and our world. . . .</p>\n<p>The novel coronavirus has been called a great equalizer because it has impacted every person in our country in some way. However, the description is not accurate, because traditionally marginalized communities have been impacted far more than other populations. African Americans, Latinxs, Native Americans, the poor, and other marginalized communities have experienced significantly higher infection, hospitalization, and death rates from COVID-19 than White Americans. Indeed, hospitalization rates for African Americans and Native Americans are five times greater than those for White Americans, and rates for Latinxs are four times greater.</p>\n<p>These numbers illustrate how unequal access to quality health care, housing, and employment has deleterious effects on marginalized communities. Health officials repeatedly urge people to practice social distancing, to wear masks, and to wash their hands often. These guidelines assume that everyone has access to what is needed to practice good public health. That is not the case. For example, many homes on rural Native American reservations and in Alaskan Native villages do not have adequate sanitation, including access to clean running water. In May 2020 the Navajo Nation had the third highest per capita rate of COVID-19, surpassing New Jersey and New York.</p>\n<p>In addition, communities of color and other traditionally marginalized groups are often caught in a vicious cycle that creates increased chances of exposure to the coronavirus. Many people can obey the orders to stay away from public places, to work from home, and to avoid close contact with other people. However, a large number of individuals in marginalized communities cannot afford to do so. Many Black and Latinx people of color cannot shelter at home because they work in “essential” job sectors such as transportation, the restaurant industry, public safety, hospitals, and grocery stores that bring them into contact with large groups of people.</p>\n<p>The virus also disproportionately affects the children of traditionally marginalized groups. As schools transitioned to remote, online learning in order to practice social distancing, these children faced barriers that those in more affluent school districts were not subjected to. Disparities in broadband adoption, commonly called the digital divide, stem from systemic racism and income inequality. Nearly half of all people in the United States without internet access at home are people of color. Approximately 15 million children in our country (21 percent of all children) live in families with incomes below the federal poverty threshold. And the percentage of Black children in poverty is at least twice as high as among White children.</p>\n<p>These children often live in conditions and family situations that are far from ideal for distance learning. How does a child effectively participate in remote learning when there is only one computer in a home? How does a child concentrate on homework when there is no designated quiet place to do so? In another illustration of how the coronavirus has disproportionately affected a particular community, hate incidents directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have sharply increased, driven at least in part by the use of the terms “Chinese virus” and “Kung Flu” by President Donald Trump. Organizers and supporters of the group Stop AAPI Hate documented 832 incidents across California from April through June 2020. Among them were 81 incidents of assault and 64 potential civil rights violations.</p>\n<p>The second pandemic, that of racial turmoil, was triggered or at least abetted by a string of violent acts by the police and others against people of color.</p>\n<p>The names George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks, and Tony McDade are just the latest to be indelibly connected to police violence—joining those of Eric Garner, Walter Scott, Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, Philando Castile, and others. And the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery by two civilians shows how “jogging while Black” and similar innocuous activities can lead to death.</p>\n<p>The killing of unarmed Black women does not receive the same degree of attention as the killing of unarmed Black men. This is a reflection, in my view, of the ongoing presence of what Frances Beal called double jeopardy in a pamphlet of that title that she wrote in 1969. Indeed, Black women can be victimized twice—because of their race and because of their gender.</p>\n<p>So we must call the names of unarmed murdered Black women just as we call those of unarmed murdered Black men: Breonna Taylor, Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Tanisha Anderson, Atatiana Jefferson, Charleena Lyles, and so many others.</p>\n<p>The protests that began in May 2020 in response to the deaths of unarmed Black women and men are organized mainly by the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Using the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media, the movement was founded in 2013 by three young Black women—Alicia Garza, Patrisse Khan-Cullors, and Opal Tometi—after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the February 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an African American teen. After the 2014 deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Gardner, the movement became nationally known for its anti-racist advocacy and protest. Today it’s a global organization that also is active in the United Kingdom and Canada.</p>\n<p>In this country, BLM is a decentralized network with more than thirty chapters. The movement is also connected to other organizations that share its mission. While Black Lives Matter protests have been centered in the U.S., similar protests over improper police treatment of people in communities of color have occurred around the world.</p>\n<p>What is it about the death of George Floyd that triggered such a strong and sustained reaction to police violence and systemic racism at this particular time in American history? I believe there are two factors. The first is how Floyd was killed by an officer who pressed his knee on his neck for almost nine minutes. The image of this brutal act, while two police officers stood by and watched as Floyd struggled to breathe, called up for me and for countless other African Americans images of shackles around the necks of enslaved Black people.</p>\n<p>In his powerful eulogy delivered at Floyd’s funeral, Rev. Al Sharpton drew on this collective memory. Rev. Sharpton passionately stated what many African Americans feel deep down in their souls: “George Floyd’s story has been the story of Black folks. Because ever since 401 years ago, the reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed to be is you kept your knee on our neck It’s time for us to stand up in George’s name and say, ‘Get your knee off our necks!’”</p>\n<p>The murder of George Floyd conjures up another image that is associated with the necks of Black people—that of racial violence in the form of lynching. Although Whites, Latinxs, Native Americans, and Asian Americans have also been lynched in the U.S., the vast majority of the victims of this profoundly brutal form of murder have been Black people—specifically Black men, although Black women and children have also been subjected to this barbaric act.</p>\n<p>Lynching historically has been a form of racial terrorism to perpetuate White supremacy and the oppression of Black people. There have been close to 4,500 documented cases of the lynching of Black men, women, and children in the United States.</p>\n<p>The second factor that triggered the mass protests that began in May 2020 is the novel coronavirus pandemic itself, which put the majority of Americans under stay-at-home orders for at least several months. Millions of people confined to their homes spent more than the usual amount of time watching TV news broadcasts and reading information on social media platforms. The murder of George Floyd and other acts of police violence were caught on smartphones and brought into living rooms via the media. As the images were played over and over again, commentators recalled the infamous and brutal police beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles in 1991. After thirty years was there still no end to such violence? The outcry began: “Enough is enough!”</p>\n<p>I should note that while I condemn the killing of unarmed women and men by police, I have a personal reason for urging that we not label all police departments and all police officers as racist and violent. One of my sons is a sergeant in a police department. In conversations with him, I have come to understand how difficult, dangerous, and often thankless his job is. Whatever the mixture of factors that produced these intense and sustained protests, our country seems to be in a different place than it was just a few months ago. And I am very cautiously optimistic that this time we might see meaningful change in addressing systemic racism.</p>\n<p>As someone who has long struggled against racism, sexism, and other systems of inequality, I welcome the incredible diversity among the protestors. I am especially impressed by the number of young White people marching and calling for an end to systemic racism.</p>\n<p>It is encouraging to hear that some police chiefs and officers are supporting change in their organizations. And there is hope that Congress might pass legislation backing needed changes, such as the outlawing of chokeholds and the establishment of a nationwide database of law enforcement officers. . . . </p>\n<p>We have reached a moment of change in our country that I hope can be sustained. However, we have been at similar hopeful moments in the past that did not last. In addition, our momentum is threatened by the “law and order” backlash in response to efforts to address systemic racism in all sectors of American society.</p>\n<p>These two movements—the call to address systemic racism, and the call to defend what are said to be “American values”— are gaining even more attention as our country heads into the 2020 presidential elections.</p>\n<p>Regardless of one’s party affiliation, it should be clear that President Trump and his loyal Republican supporters firmly oppose the Black Lives Matter movement as they speak and act in terms of a cultural war. For example, in the middle of a substantial increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, the president held an event on July 3 at Mount Rushmore—despite protests by Native Americans that the land is sacred to them, and despite the concerns of public health officials about the gathering of 7,500 supporters who did not practice social distancing and who were not required to wear masks.</p>\n<p>At the event, Trump spoke of “a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children.” And, he referred to those protesting the killing of George Floyd and other Black Americans as “angry mobs [who] are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities.” He added: “In our schools, our newsrooms, even our corporate boardrooms, there is a new far-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance.”</p>\n<p>As the issues that are dividing Americans in our current state of racial turmoil become more and more intense, the three Phi Beta Kappa Mercer lectures that I presented in 2019, and that are the basis of this book, have new importance.</p>\n<p>In them, I lifted up the critical importance of the humanities in the kind of effective education that is needed in our schools, colleges, and universities. I also encouraged the teaching of the history of racism in our country as a prerequisite to combating it. And I called for courageous conversations about race and racism to take place in the academy as well as in our communities.</p>\n<p>It is my hope that everyone who reads this book will find something that is helpful in their ongoing efforts to understand and challenge racism in American public life.

Words matter, and ideas have consequences. Rival visions have agitated American national politics from the beginning. The revolution of 1776 tested whether our enduring political commitments would be grounded upon inherited views determined by consanguinity, tradition, and chance, or would be animated by visions for a new American republic defined by principles, reason, and choice. Subsequent presidential elections—from Thomas Jefferson to Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant—confirmed that, even when vexed by deep or hostile divisions, this nation rests upon a foundation and a constitutional order that ensure this republic shall endure; if, that is, we adhere to its guiding principles in the pursuit of justice and the equal protection of rights under our laws, even as we strive to correct its flaws and strengthen our union. </p>\n<p>Rival visions cannot be avoided in a free republic, but their contestation must abide by republican rules. The articulation of opposing arguments, whether of a majority or a minority of the people, must be reasonable in order to be rightful. The assault on and breach of a Congress flush with Senators and Representatives at work cannot, and must not, be forgotten. Not only an iconic symbol but the constitutional substance of our popular sovereignty has been attacked. In our republic (if we can keep it), this violation strikes at our core principles. Legitimate political authority in a republican form of government is exercised not through insurrection but persuasion, not through the threat of mob rule but self-government. The ship of state requires prudent leaders at the helm and responsible citizens pulling oars, for ours is a government of laws and not of passions. Threats—whether posed in speech or in deed—to the constitutional rule of law in our republic must be met with vigilance. </p>\n<p>President-Elect Biden (and his speech-writers) in his upcoming inaugural address on January 20 will surely reach back into the past for inspiration in summoning the eloquence needed to meet this critical moment in our nation’s history. The rhetorical presidency must be for us once more a beacon of light and guidance in a time of crisis and national darkness. Speeches of President Jefferson and President Lincoln at their first inaugurals come quickly to mind, and, perhaps even more fittingly, the words of Washington in unmasking false claims of patriotic zeal and suppressing insurrections, first by debunking conspiracy among the ranks of the Continental Army in 1783, and again, as President, when facing down “insurgents” (as he called them) during the whiskey rebellion of 1794.     </p>\n<p>The U.S. Capitol building is a soaring symbol of legitimate popular authority, its majestic dome finished by order of Lincoln during our national crisis and rising over the district that bears the name of Washington. It must not be assaulted as if it were the Bastille in Paris in 1789. The Spirit of ’76 and the American Revolution will always be the touchstone for principled resistance to tyranny, but the violation that we witnessed last week—to subvert by force the constitutional certification of electoral votes in a presidential election—looked like a parody of a scene from the French Revolution. Parodic not because the intent and actions of the protesters were in any way laughable and defensible (they were not), but because the French revolutionaries sought to overthrow centuries of oppression and injustice (as Jefferson himself famously affirmed in writing that “rebellion now and then is a good thing” and that “the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants”).                                                   </p>\n<p>Following the intensely contested Election of 1800, with its rival visions of the future of the young American republic vigorously articulated in vitriolic rhetoric, the incoming President-Elect understood his inaugural address had to restore a sense of unity. The war of words fought through heated ‘campaigns’ in ‘battle-ground’ States must end, said Jefferson, once the votes had been cast: “the contest of opinion through which we have passed” having been “decided by the voice of the nation, [and] announced according to the rules of the Constitution, all will, of course,” he asserted with faith in the reasonableness of his fellow-citizens, “arrange themselves under the will of the law, and unite in common efforts for the common good.” So too must we all. </p>\n<p>But the times now seem ominously more like 1861 than 1801. President Lincoln hopefully said, in his inaugural address, as confederate agitators and insurgents precipitated civil war: “We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.” Differences of opinion cannot be allowed to become violations of principle. Impassioned opinions must be scrutinized for the veracity of their assertions and submitted to the bar of public reason. And the rhetoric of radical political intolerance, which distorts reason and incites violence, must be firmly rejected. Rival visions inflamed by passion and mis-information can still break to new mutiny, making civil hands unclean with civil blood. So even as we wish for the best, we must also be vigilant and prepared to support and defend the integrity of our republican institutions. Let us not abandon our fundamental commitment to the constitutional principles that define us as a republic.</p>\n<p>We anxiously await now as we have in the past an exhortation in words, as well as an example in deeds; words animated by that noble vision of an American republic which our founders first conceived and established, and to which later reformers remained dedicated in advancing liberty, justice, and equal rights for all. What we hope to hear, therefore, as our nation lingers on the verge of further civil discord, is a redeeming vision of our republic that will strengthen the state of our union and encourage the chords of civic spirit to be again touched by the better angels of our nature.  </p>\n<p>#PodSaveTheRepublic</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Rival Visions vs. Insurrections: The Challenge of an Inaugural Address in a Time of Crisis","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"5178","Title":"Rival Visions"}],"date":"2021-01-21"},"fields":{"slug":"/rival-visions-vs-insurrections-the-challenge-of-an-inaugural-address-in-a-time-of-crisis"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>We are pleased to offer this essay for Inauguration Day by Robert M.

they recognized that the union they constituted, made “more perfect” and stretched to its tenuous limits, could all too easily fall apart.  They did not speak with a single voice, nor were their various original intentions fulfilled.  Yet the idea, aspiration, or inspiring fiction of nationhood endures, animated by the hopes, fears, and conflicts of successive generations, always destined to be an experiment—unless and until it finally fails.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5617\"><em>Revolutionary Prophecies</em> </a>surveys the wide array of hopes and fears that united and divided Americans in the first decades of our national history.  Distinguished contributors to this collection focus on familiar figures—from Benjamin Franklin to George Washington, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and James Monroe—as well as on less familiar individuals and groups within and beyond the patriot coalition.  In the crucible of the Revolution, sectional conflict, and foreign wars that threatened to engulf and destroy the new nation, prominent statesmen negotiated tenuous compromises over questions of conflicting interest and principle in order to sustain the “common cause.”  Their most conspicuous disagreements centered on how they defined the “people” and on how the ordinary citizens who were mobilized to fight and pay for the war would participate in their own government.  Anxious Anglo-American elites feared mob rule, the lawless reign of demagogues and democrats; indebted and overtaxed farmers in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and across the continent feared losing their farms and freedoms to a rising class of home-grown aristocrats.  Drafters of new state constitutions sought to channel and mitigate conflict by establishing broadly acceptable rules of the game, building trust and civic capital so a plurality of interests could flourish.  These more or less successful, often controversial “peace plans” for the states provided the template for a continental peace compact for an even more problematic and controversial federal union—the union that would eventually collapse in the Civil War.  Drafted in wartime, the first American constitutions also marked out sharp, racially inflected boundaries between the people and potential enemies at home (“legally” enslaved people in every original state) and abroad (including Indian nations with which American diplomats negotiated treaties).</p>\n<p>When Americans ratified the federal Constitution, exultant commentators proclaimed it a “miracle,” attributing its surprising success to a benign providence—and so acknowledging fundamental, seemingly intractable differences among themselves and with the “powers of the earth” that threatened anarchy, disunion, and counter-revolution.  Prophecies of peace, prosperity, and a new republican order for the ages reflected the desperation of a people—or peoples—in the wake of a protracted era of unsettlement, insecurity, and regime change dating back to the onset of the Anglo-American imperial crisis of the 1760s.  This was no golden age of patriotic unity, and it should not surprise us now that Revolutionary prophecies struck such a broad range of often discordant, conflicting notes.  In listening to their testimony, however, we can ask ourselves how our circumstances and the challenges we face compare with theirs. </p>\n<p>Revolutionary Americans—as much and perhaps even more than Americans today—had no idea of what was coming next.  In our darkest moments we bemoan deepening division, a coming apart or fracturing of what was once whole, united, exceptional, and great.  Our Revolutionary forbears saw things differently.  Their desperation reflected profound anxieties about whether would-be Americans would ever <em>come together</em> sufficiently to secure the legacy of liberty they hoped to leave for future generations.  Were the people vigilant enough and their representatives virtuous enough to make the republican experiment succeed and so sustain the liberties they cherished?  Distrusting themselves—whether as Christian sinners or as faithful adherents of the rule of law—they had ample reason to distrust their countrymen, and much more reason to distrust the peoples of distant, nearly foreign states (or countries) in the Revolutionary federal alliance.  Their leap of faith was <em>toward</em> “a more perfect union” of their newly constituted state-republics.  They declared, imagined, and aspired to a new collective, national identity, but they did so as “realists,” wary of potential assaults on their rights—including their “right” to own human property.</p>\n<p>We rightly congratulate ourselves on having achieved—or at least aspiring to achieve—a more capacious and inclusive conception of our national community.  And the authors of the New York <em>Times’</em> <em>1619</em> project are certainly right to emphasize the critical and continuing importance of racial slavery and its legacies for our national narrative.  But 1776 still matters, and now more than ever. What we have (or should have) in common with the original revolutionaries—and with individuals and groups equally animated by the “spirit of 1776” in their ongoing quest for equality and inclusion—is a recognition of the transcendent value of a constitution and civic community that enables us to aspire to an ever more perfect union.</p>\n<p>This is not our prophecy and we don’t pretend to speak for anyone else, and particularly not for our excellent authors.  We certainly don’t know what’s coming next.  But we take the liberty of expressing our hopes for the future, as we have sought to discern those of a diverse and divided Revolutionary generation.  Call it a prayer.</p>\n<p><strong>Robert M.

Until this year, the closeness of the two events has been unremarkable and unremarked upon. This year, of course, is different. On January 6, a violent mob breached several layers of security at the Capitol and killed and wounded police officers amid destructive mayhem. Today, the country braces for more unrest, as we celebrate the life and legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. What would King have had to say to the mob as it mounted the Capitol steps? What is the purpose or efficacy of radical nonviolence as a counter to an armed, murderous insurrection?</p>\n<p>On Martin Luther King Day many words are spoken about nonviolence, but the word and concept are rarely interrogated or simply relegated to the large class of “beautiful but impractical” ideas. King would have been appalled by the insurrectionary violence at the Capitol, but not surprised. White violence and the asymmetries of power shaped the contours of every Black life in the America into which he was born, came of age, and was murdered. He never underestimated the strength of the resistance to the Black freedom struggle. And yet he was undaunted in his belief in nonviolence.</p>\n<p>For King, nonviolence was less a political tactic, to be switched on and off, and more of a lifelong spiritual discipline. In this, he learned much from his older contemporary, the African American religious thinker Howard Thurman (1899–1981), the first prominent Black pacifist. Like King, Thurman was a scion of Jim Crow South, and like King, he was a Morehouse College graduate. It was at Morehouse that Thurman was converted to pacifism in the early 1920s. His pacifism was specific to his circumstances. He found in it “a place to stand in my own spirit—a place so profoundly affirming that I was strengthened by a sense of immunity to the assaults of the white world of Atlanta, Georgia.” At the time, pacifism was changing from a movement of well-to-do well-intentioned people who wished to do away with war to a commitment to a way of living. For Thurman the primary focus of his pacifism was to counter white violence, explicit and implicit. By affirming himself, he denied dominion to the forces that would contort and diminish Black lives. His philosophy of nonviolence boiled down to these tenets: Do not give into fear, do not be afraid to speak truth, or hide behind comfortable lies. Do not allow hate to dominate your thoughts or actions. And then begin the process, painful on both sides, of deep reconciliation with one’s former oppressors. Thurman outlined his thoughts about radical nonviolence in his most important book, <em>Jesus and the Disinherited</em>, in 1949. Martin Luther King, Jr., then a second year seminary student, was one of its first readers. It became one of his favorite books; he often carried it on his travels.</p>\n<p>Thurman crossed paths with King occasionally. In 1953–54, during Thurman’s first year as dean of chapel at Boston University, for example, the younger King was in residence, completing his dissertation, often attending chapel services to hear Thurman preach. They would stay in touch as King made his ascent from family friend and graduate student to one of the most famous people in the world. Thurman’s influence on other leaders of the civil rights movement was even more direct; he directly mentored both James Farmer, his student at Howard University, and a co-founder of CORE in 1942, the first civil rights organization to systematically practice radical nonviolence, and Pauli Murray, another student he met at Howard.</p>\n<p>Thurman closely followed King’s career and the trajectory of the civil rights movement. After hearing of King’s murder on April 4, 1968, Thurman was distraught. It was an assassination of a friend, and an assassination of everything he held dear about his country and the struggle of Black Americans for their freedom. Still, he accepted his public role as a speaker, explainer, and comforter. He told one audience that the point of nonviolence was not to refrain from violence, but to challenge it, forcefully, creatively, and collectively: “If Martin had been an apostle of nonviolence without adding nonviolent direct action, then at the center of his nonviolence would have been a sort of sticky piety.” At the same time, Thurman explained that the purpose of nonviolent direct action is less to defeat one’s opponents but to convert them and make them see the hopelessness and the evil of their former positions: “Martin was sure that there is a place in every man’s heart that waits and listens to the sound of the genuine in every other man. And we must therefore, reduce all of the other noises created by fear, by poverty, by panic, by hate, that the sound of the genuine in your heart might be heard by the sound of the genuine in my heart.”</p>\n<p>King titled his last book <em>Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?</em> It is always a pertinent question. There have been, in the last few days, calls for “healing” and “reconciliation” by the aiders and abetters of violence. Thurman and King had no patience with sham or faux reconciliations, weak compromises that left everyone dissatisfied, or efforts to “understand” one’s opponents that accepted their biases and prejudices at face value. Radical nonviolence, for Thurman and for King, was a spiritual discipline to transform oneself, one’s opponents, and society as a whole. Either our efforts to transform the world for the better must be rooted in the recognition of our common humanity, or they are doomed to failure. As Thurman told the crowd at Fellowship Church, the interracial church in San Francisco that he had founded, on the Sunday after King’s death: “For better or worse we are tied together in one bundle and I can never be what I must be until you are what you must be; for better or worse that is the only option.

The need for close and well-functioning ties between scientific evidence and political decisions, when it comes to overcoming health challenges caused by pandemics, has been at the center of many discussions. This, however, is nothing new to our historical moment. A look into Alexander von Humboldt’s and Thomas Jefferson’s times provides an insightful example of how these connections were of the same importance and societal relevance in the past. In addition, this glimpse into the past gives us an inspiring example for transatlantic collaboration aimed to benefit society: Looking at the challenges caused by the infectious diseases of their times – such as smallpox, but also yellow fever and the plague – and the solutions elaborated at the intersection of science and politics is helpful in order to draw insightful lessons from the past. Just as today, these diseases neither took the borders of nations into account nor were the concerns and hopes of the people substantially different on either side of the Atlantic. These health and societal challenges, in fact, connected the continents in multiple ways.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>In 1808, referring to an expedition carried out by the Spanish Crown, Alexander von Humboldt wrote in his <em>Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain</em>: “The voyage of Mr. Balmis will thus remain for ever memorable in the annals of history.” The expedition that received such a tribute from the famous explorer was the first major vaccination campaign, the Royal Philanthropic Vaccine Expedition (1803–1806), led by the Spanish military physician <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Javier_de_Balmis\" title=\"Francisco Javier de Balmis\">Francisco Javier de Balmis</a> y Berenguer (1753–1819). Vaccination, a much safer way to prevent smallpox than older methods such as inoculation, had been introduced only a few years earlier, by the English physician Edward Jenner (1749–1823). In 1798, Jenner had published the results of his research under the title <em>An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolæ Vaccinæ</em> (1798)<em>,</em> followed by two other books on this topic: <em>Further Observations on the Variolæ Vaccinæ, or Cow-Pox</em> (1799) and <em>A Continuation of Facts and Observations Relative to the Variolæ Vaccinæ, or Cow-Pox</em> (1800). For his part, Balmis had devoted much time and energy to medical research, focusing especially on venereal diseases. For several years he had worked as a hospital surgeon in the city of Mexico and had at the same time investigated local flora and traditional remedies used by Indigenous peoples, which led to the publication of <em>Tratado de las virtudes del agave y la begonia</em> (1794). During his time in New Spain he had also witnessed the terrible effect of smallpox on the local population.</p>\n<p>After his return to Madrid Balmis became the physician of King Charles IV, whose daughter Maria Teresa died from smallpox in 1794, as had his brother Gabriel a few years earlier, along with his wife and their new-born son. Through this personal tragedy the monarch was certainly more sensitized to the tremendous impact the health crisis had in the Spanish colonies than he otherwise might have been. Shortly after Jenner had begun developing the smallpox vaccine, Balmis developed his plan to take the new vaccine to North America, South America, and the Philippines. The purpose of this mission, considered to be the first international healthcare expedition in history, was to put the latest scientific advances into practice in order to end the high mortality caused by this disease in the Spanish empire. So as to achieve this goal, people were going to be trained on site to use the vaccination method, and another part of the strategy involved setting up vaccination centers. Balmis obtained the approval and generous support of Charles IV for his plan, but one important logistic problem had to be solved first: the vaccine had to be kept viable during the entire expedition. Balmis found a solution in the form of twenty-two orphaned children, who served as a vaccine transmission belt. Although his expedition faced numerous obstacles in the colonies, given a certain suspicion among both local officials and resident populations, it was successful and eventually saved a large number of lives.</p>\n<p>The Balmis expedition arrived in New Spain in August 1804, only a few months after Humboldt had left this viceroyalty on his way to Cuba and from there to the United States, where he would meet President Jefferson in June of 1804. Humboldt had observed the devastating impact of smallpox in Spanish America and showed his deep concerns in his <em>Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain,</em> describing the different efforts that had been over time made to protect the population. Interestingly, he not only summarized the history of vaccination from a European perspective but also pointed to the Indigenous knowledge found in colonial America. Based on this personal experience, he was optimistic, both regarding the outcome of Jenner’s work in general and the Royal Philanthropic Vaccine Expedition in particular. His prediction regarding the Spanish vaccination campaign, however, proved wrong—rather than remaining “for ever memorable in the annals of history,” it was quickly forgotten, even in Spain—until the military operation supporting the fight against COVID 19 was named “Operación Balmis.” In Balmis’ times, however, it received much attention as a scientific experiment, but also as an expression of the political elite’s health concerns. In England, Jenner himself was thrilled when he learned about this vaccination expedition: “I don't imagine the annals of history furnish an example of philanthropy so noble, so extensive as this,” he wrote in 1806 to a friend.</p>\n<p>For his part, Thomas Jefferson was an early advocate of the smallpox inoculation; he had already obtained this protection in 1766. Then, from the start, he was one of the strongest supporters of the new vaccination method in the United States, an effort that in turn was recognized in 1803 by the recently founded <em>Royal Jennerian Society for the Extermination of the Small-pox</em> in London.[[1]](<a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/2021/01/04/sandra-rebok-bringing-enlightenment-science-practice#_ftn1)%C2%A0Note\">https://www.upress.virginia.edu/2021/01/04/sandra-rebok-bringing-enlightenment-science-practice#_ftn1) Note</a>, for example, that in the long list of instructions that Jefferson passed to Meriwether Lewis for what was going to become the Lewis and Clark expedition (1804—1806), he advised him not only to vaccinate members of his party against smallpox but also to instruct Indigenous peoples on the use of this practice.[[2]](<a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/2021/01/04/sandra-rebok-bringing-enlightenment-science-practice#_ftn2)%C2%A0In\">https://www.upress.virginia.edu/2021/01/04/sandra-rebok-bringing-enlightenment-science-practice#_ftn2) In</a> other words, Jefferson, too, added a version of an early vaccination campaign to the tasks of this exploratory voyage. In 1806, he wrote in a letter to George C. Jenner, Edward Jenner’s nephew, who applied his uncle’s method and vaccinated thousands of people: “Medecine has never before produced any single improvement of such utility.”[[3]](<a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/2021/01/04/sandra-rebok-bringing-enlightenment-science-practice#_ftn3\">https://www.upress.virginia.edu/2021/01/04/sandra-rebok-bringing-enlightenment-science-practice#_ftn3</a>)</p>\n<p>The political authorities’ enthusiasm for this new medical breakthrough, on both sides of the Atlantic, was closely connected to the common goal of the Age of Reason: generating knowledge that could be used for societal progress was at the core of Enlightenment sciences. Both Humboldt and Jefferson, albeit from different angles, are excellent examples of how this general pursuit was put into practice. Promoting scientific inquiry in order to address the challenges of their world, and implementing the outcome for the benefit of humanity was their vision of science's place in society.</p>\n<p>Infectious diseases had had a disastrous impact on societies worldwide, not only by acting in a cruel way on people’s lives, but also by being a threat to societal development in all parts of the globe. Both Jefferson and Humboldt had observed the consequences with their own eyes and hence both saw this as a challenge for the sciences to solve, on a global level. A health crisis caused by infectious diseases always expands beyond the border of nations; it thus needs to be understood as an international task requiring collaborative effort to address and solve. This was the case then, at the turn of the nineteenth century, when smallpox and its vaccination strengthened both transatlantic connections writ large and the personal ties between scientists, explorers, and political decision makers. And this is the way it ought to be approached in our times.</p>\n<p>It would be interesting to know if either Jenner’s medical breakthrough, or the way it was practically applied by the Spanish crown, was a topic of conversation during Humboldt and Jefferson’s personal encounters in Washington. Unfortunately, the existing records do not provide an answer. Nevertheless, it is very likely, given the concern both historical figures shared in this regard, that they might have exchanged thoughts on the promising scientific developments of their day.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>[[1]](<a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/2021/01/04/sandra-rebok-bringing-enlightenment-science-practice#_ftnref1)%C2%A0%E2%80%9CTo\">https://www.upress.virginia.edu/2021/01/04/sandra-rebok-bringing-enlightenment-science-practice#_ftnref1) “To</a> Thomas Jefferson from Charles Murray, 4 July 1803,” <em>Founders Online,</em> National Archives, <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-40-02-0501\">https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-40-02-0501</a>.</p>\n<p>[[2]](<a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/2021/01/04/sandra-rebok-bringing-enlightenment-science-practice#_ftnref2)%C2%A0IV\">https://www.upress.virginia.edu/2021/01/04/sandra-rebok-bringing-enlightenment-science-practice#_ftnref2) IV</a>.

Washington, who emerged from slavery to become one of the leading African American intellectuals around the turn of the 20th century, had ties to Charlottesville that eventually led to a city park being named after him.</p>\n<p>A new connection between Washington and this area will be forged virtually via the University of Virginia Press’ electronic imprint, Rotunda, which has acquired “The Booker T. Washington Papers” to create a digital edition.</p>\n<p>Washington – an author, pioneer in higher education, adviser to presidents and business leaders, and a pillar in the emerging Black elite and middle class – helped conceive a future for an educated, prosperous Black society in the wake of emancipation and Reconstruction. His views and ideas were not without controversy, however.</p>\n<p>The son of an enslaved Virginia woman, Washington was born in Franklin County (near Rocky Mount and Roanoke) in 1856. After emancipation, his mother moved the family to Malden, West Virginia. Washington identified education as the pathway out of poverty, a necessity for his voracious intellect and the focus of his professional life.</p>\n<p>He walked 500 miles to get his education at Hampton Institute, where he met fellow students and Charlottesville natives Benjamin Tonsler and George P. Inge Sr.</p>\n<p>“While known worldwide, Mr. Washington also had a close relationship to Charlottesville,” Suzanne Morse Moomaw, director of UVA Press, said. “He was a personal friend of Mr. Benjamin Tonsler from their college days at Hampton and is known to have stayed at his home, but also with the Inge family on West Main Street. The city’s first recreation area for African Americans is named for him, Booker T. Washington Park on Preston Avenue.”</p>\n<p>This digital edition is based on the landmark 14-volume print series of Washington’s papers, originally published by the University of Illinois Press between 1970 to 1989. It is considered one of the great documentary editions in American scholarship – “a major enterprise in Black historiography,” according to the Times Literary Supplement.</p>\n<p>The online archive, expected to be available in spring 2021, will collect the complete contents of the print edition; it will be fully searchable and interoperable with other titles in Rotunda’s American History Collection.</p>\n<p>“This collection allows us to know Mr. Washington in new ways,” Moomaw said.</p>\n<p>At the age of 25, Washington served as the first president of what is now Tuskegee University, to this day one of the premier historically Black universities in America. He held the job until his death at 59 in 1915. As Tuskegee’s president, he forged relationships with the most powerful philanthropist-industrialists of the day, including Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, establishing a network of donors that reflected Washington’s belief in, and talent for, working with the white establishment.</p>\n<p>Washington was known to have differences with other Black scholars, especially with the prominent historian, civil rights activist and editor W.E.B. Du Bois, who cofounded the NAACP.</p>\n<p>Washington’s landmark Atlanta Exposition speech in 1895 called for an African American investment in industrial education and accumulation of wealth as a way of integrating Blacks into society at large. This position was not uncontroversial; passionate activists such as Du Bois criticized it as being too conservative.</p>\n<p>The surrounding debates are foundational to the most vital discussions in Black discourse: How can Black Americans best advance themselves, and can true equality and equity be achieved in the face of white oppression and the legacies of segregationist public policy?</p>\n<p>“There is a remarkable range of material in ‘The Booker T. Washington Papers’ – not only his complete correspondence and several published books, but a wealth of documentary material from his time at Hampton Institute, and of course from Tuskegee,” said David Sewell, manager of digital initiatives and the Rotunda imprint. “From the 1890s on, the list of his correspondents includes most of the prominent philanthropists and politicians of his day, North and South.</p>\n<p>“As an addition to the Rotunda American History Collection, his papers will substantially bridge the temporal gap between the papers of Ulysses S. Grant and Woodrow Wilson, just as his career formed an arc from slavery through the Reconstruction to the civil rights struggles of the early 20th century.”</p>\n<p>Over Washington Park’s nearly 100-year history, it has reflected changes from the era of segregation to the current day.</p>\n<p>In 1926, businessman Paul Goodloe McIntire gave land to the city to establish two parks: McIntire Park for whites and Washington Park for African Americans. It is believed that McIntire consulted Tonsler on the name of the park, but it is unclear why it took more than 75 years to officially rename it, according to the Charlottesville Parks and Grounds website.</p>\n<p>The park was re-dedicated in 2001 as Booker T. Washington Park during the annual African American Cultural Arts Festival.</p>\n<p>This article was written by Emily Grandstaff and Anne E.

We invite you to check out these resources and to read Tom Kapsidelis’s reflections on evolving student activism around the issue of gun safety—a topic that remains highly pertinent in 2020.</em></p>\n<p>------------------------------------</p>\n<p>In the bitter campaign year of 2020, I’ve often thought about Colin Goddard’s meeting with Vice President Joe Biden after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012.</p>\n<p>President Barack Obama had established a vice presidential task force that sought the views of shooting survivors, including those from Virginia Tech. Goddard, shot and wounded in his French class, had become a national gun safety advocate. In an interview for my book, <em>After Virginia Tech: Guns, Safety, and Healing in the Era of Mass Shootings</em>, Goddard told me that rather than push legislation with the vice president, he took a more personal approach. When Biden subsequently introduced the president at a White House meeting to announce the administration’s gun safety objectives in early 2013, he reflected on what he had learned from Goddard.</p>\n<p>“When I asked Colin about what he thought we should be doing, he said, ‘I’m not here because of what happened to me. I’m here because what happened to me keeps happening to other people and we have to do something about it,’” Biden recounted. “Colin, we will. Colin, I promise you, we will. This is our intention. We must do what we can now.”</p>\n<p>Though the U.S. Senate rejected gun safety legislation on what Obama called a “shameful day,” the drive for change that grew from Newtown, Blacksburg, and other communities torn by gun violence would continue. Survivors and their supporters fostered an empathy that they understand best—and perhaps President-elect Biden does as well.</p>\n<p>Since 2018, we’ve watched as the students and families from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, established those same types of connections. It was also a reaffirmation for the Tech survivors, who are credited with helping build a template for involvement. Their work achieved prominence beyond Second Amendment issues, addressing community safety, the needs of survivors, and mental health.</p>\n<p>“I see us in them—but with a platform, since social media has come so far since 2007,” said John Woods, a Tech graduate who was honored by the Obama White House for his gun safety advocacy in Texas. Goddard told me he felt the same sentiment, as did Kristina Anderson, a shooting survivor whose foundation has focused on safe communities, violence prevention, and trauma recovery.</p>\n<p>They speak directly to a generation that has grown up amid the dangers of gun violence. In March 2018, <em>The Washington Post</em> reported that over the two decades since the Columbine High School attack in 1999, more than 187,000 primary and secondary students “have experienced a shooting on campus during school hours.” <em>The Post</em> called this “the collateral damage of this uniquely American crisis.”</p>\n<p>Through the voices of Anderson, Goddard, Woods, and others, today’s college students can learn about the long journeys that continue after the glare of immediate news coverage fades. The Tech graduates know the challenges of physical recovery and what goes into coping with the emotional trauma and memories that endure over a lifetime. Some are now parents, bringing added dimensions to how they view their experiences.</p>\n<p>I was drawn to this history from my work for the <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em>, which assigned me to Blacksburg to organize and edit the coverage on April 16, 2007. Thirty-two students and professors were slain on that unseasonably cold morning. At the time it was the nation’s largest contemporary mass shooting. I arrived on campus about 4 o’clock that afternoon and remained on duty over the next two days.</p>\n<p>When I returned to Richmond later that week, I sensed that the tragedy could lead to reforms—that legislators would embrace gun safety laws and other measures to make Virginia safer and honor the memories of those killed. That sense of optimism dimmed as I observed little change over the next three years. What I saw instead was that even while Tech families were undergoing their own physical and emotional healing, they were engaged in mighty struggles—from accountability questions regarding what took place before, during, and after the attack to the realities of advocating for gun safety legislation during an era of expanding gun rights.</p>\n<p>I began reporting for my book at the third anniversary memorial at Virginia Tech on April 16, 2010, which was followed three days later by armed gun rights rallies in Northern Virginia that presaged today’s threatening armed Second Amendment demonstrations.</p>\n<p>What unfolded for me was a multigenerational history, involving young people and their families whose lives were changed by their work as advocates. As a graduate student in Texas, Woods, whose girlfriend was fatally shot at Tech, made connections with survivors of the 1966 University of Texas Tower shootings who were opposed to the carrying of concealed weapons on campus.</p>\n<p>Virginia finally achieved a historic breakthrough when the 2020 General Assembly approved a package of gun safety laws after 13 years of tireless lobbying led by Lori Haas, whose daughter, Emily, was wounded at Tech, and Goddard’s father, Andrew Goddard. But it also took a political power shift at the Capitol—Democrats won control of the House and Senate in 2019 after Republicans quickly shut down a special session on gun safety that Gov. Ralph Northam called in response to the murders of 12 at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center.</p>\n<p>The debate for national reforms, meantime, continues in Washington, where progress thus far has remained elusive under a divided Congress and a divisive presidential administration in 2020. Gun sales are at record levels, weapons are carried openly at political rallies, and more than a dozen men in Michigan have been charged in connection with a plot to abduct the governor. And as the nation struggles with the pandemic, many communities have seen an increase in gun violence.</p>\n<p>But Biden now gets a chance to make good on his promise to Goddard. This time, the connections across the decades have been well established. The work of the Virginia Tech community can help make today’s students aware of what’s at stake in the push to create a safer nation. We can hope that future generations might read the Tech students’ experiences as history, and not as their reality.</p>\n<p>Read more #UPWeek posts from our fellow university presses here: <a href=\"https://upweek.up.hcommons.org/celebrate/up-week-2020/up-week-2020-blog-tour/\">https://upweek.up.hcommons.org/celebrate/up-week-2020/up-week-2020-blog-...</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Celebrating UP Week with Tom Kapsidelis, author of After Virginia Tech","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"5226","Title":"After Virginia Tech"}],"date":"2020-11-30"},"fields":{"slug":"/celebrating-up-week-with-tom-kapsidelis-author-of-after-virginia-tech"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Over 98 million U.S. citizens have already voted in this year’s presidential election.

Did you happen upon an evocative primary source that made you rethink received wisdom? Or did a contemporary event want to make you investigate its antecedents?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I don’t think any contemporary event sparked my interest in what I wrote. If anything, I was just fascinated by the revolution, its causes, and how that shaped our futures. I remember reading the secondary literature when I started the project and wondering how the different colonial governments and the way they governed fit with our understanding of the impulse for independence and revolution. I started to answer that question by creating a database of petitions to Pennsylvania’s colonial legislature from 1740 to 1775, trying to find common complaints and requests. Through that, I focused on public petitions, or, rather, petitions signed by multiple people asking for legislative action. Once there, it became readily apparent that there was a severe disconnect between how the government and the governed understood the basic elements of governance. Tracking the dialogue between “the people” and the government in other sources, such as court records, newspapers, pamphlets, broadsides, and private papers framed the book as it now exists. I think it all came together when I started to see the same requests over and again demanding reform of the judicial system and regulatory policies. When those grievances started to make their way into the public political dialogue of the 1760s and 1770s and the same ideas for change cropped up in the state constitution and subsequent legislation by the state government, I knew I had a really interesting thread to track down and write about.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>You emphasize the importance of studying the \"practice of governing\" in <em>Conceived in Crisis</em>. What do you mean by the concept and why is it important for historians to do so?</strong> </li>\n</ol>\n<p>I think it is really important to investigate the practice of governing rather than just the ideas behind governance. When we talk or write about governance in early America, we tend to focus on theoretical assumptions or the structure of a government rather than, say, what those things actually meant on the ground for people. I wanted to figure out what those ideas and structures meant for colonists’ everyday lives. For example, it became pretty clear through investigating petitions, court records, and newspapers/pamphlets that colonists understood government as actively upholding the public welfare rather than a government instituted for the benefit of a select few or class of people. That is all well and good, but how would that apply in normal situations? If you look at what petitioners asked for, that question is easily answered. They wanted the regulation of markets, fishing, hunting, consumer goods- a seemingly never-ending list of stuff, and they wanted new officers for enforcement, a reform of the courts based on population and logistics, and a host of issues that would have substantially altered the way the colonial governments actually governed. This was the stuff that defined their lives and the way they perceived any government and its effectiveness. More important still, those experiences entered into the popular dialogue about the efficacy and viability of the British empire in the 1760s and 1770s, and continued to shape how people responded to the state governments after American independence. If we ignore the practice of governing, then, we miss those clear connections, and, I think, we miss how early Americans understood the purpose of government and what motivated revolutionaries in creating the states.   </p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>You have a great eye for evocative quotations. Do you have a favorite? If yes, what does it reveal to you?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This question made me laugh as I thought about some of the quotes I really enjoyed. Some I liked because they were spot on and just a little bawdy, such as a “Popular Song” in Northampton County, Pennsylvania that spelled “justice” in Pennsylvania “just-ass,” which was really amazing to find because it connected to the complaints of petitioners. I do have two favorites, though, both written as Pennsylvanians contemplated the destruction of the colonial government and the creation of a new independent state in the spring and summer of 1776. The first was published that June in the <em>Pennsylvania Packet</em> by someone calling themselves “The Watchman.”  The author made it seem a forgone conclusion that Pennsylvania’s colonial government was “the worst in the world.” As I show in the book, that quote is a product of a divisive debate over the effectiveness and, ultimately, legitimacy of the colonial government that started in earnest in the 1760s. By “in earnest,” I mean that disparate complaints about governance started to inform public debates where people across the colony realized that they shared common grievances. A powerful moment. The second quote came from Thomas Smith writing about his experience in the state constitutional convention in the summer of 1776. Smith, a member of the state constitutional convention, understood that the job of the convention was “to clear every part of the old rubbish out of the way and begin upon a clear foundation.” That for me was an essential quote as it spoke to the idea that the colonial government and how it governed needed to be substantially altered. Even more important, he was not referencing the creation of a plural executive council or a unicameral assembly, but the reform of the judicial system, particularly the justices of the peace. I could trace the thread from colonial petitions since 1740 to this moment of change. </p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Your story unfolds chronologically. Did you write chapters in order or not? Which one was your favorite to write?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Oddly enough, I wrote them in order. I mean, I did a lot of the research for all of the chapters and I mapped out a plan, but each chapter needed more research as I wrote, so I decided early on that I would start from the beginning. That is not how I normally write, honestly. I usually have an idea and start where I can, but with this book I knew I needed to start from the first chapter and move forward as any additional research would obviously change the trajectory and the argument. I wrote the introduction last, which was the hardest part to write. I remember sitting there looking at all of these pieces, a sort of jangled collection of ideas, and reading them again and again until I could clarify my thoughts in a way that made sense to everyone else. . . and then I had to go back through and revise it accordingly.</p>\n<p>Sadly, I don’t have a favorite chapter. The writing phase was not my favorite part in any way, shape, or form. I loved the research, though. I really loved researching chapters 3, 4, and 5, especially since I did the bulk of research for those chapters at the William L. Clements Library, the American Philosophical Society, the International Center for Jefferson Studies, and the David Library of the American Revolution. I have never felt more focused in my life than when at those places, and the basic contours of the book came into view there.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Based on your insights from <em>Conceived in Crisis</em>, what distinguishes ineffective from competent state government? What should citizens look for?</strong> </li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"\">That is a really easy and hard question to answer. If the readers are still with me, I would like to provide a prolonged answer that is both modern and drawn from the past that I write about in my book.  </a></p>\n<p>I think, for me, an effective government is one that has the institutional wherewithal and political will to act on behalf of the <em>entire</em> public’s welfare. The colonial and revolutionary state governments had real issues in this respect, and it mostly had to do with their narrow definition of who should be included in “the public” when white (often male) colonists, politicians, and local government officials thought about institutions, policies, and law enforcement procedures.</p>\n<p>Not only should a government represent “the people,” but government should consider and critically evaluate the way it defines “the people” it represents. The contradictory ways that the American public and the governments of the United States have defined “the people” through history has resulted in a powerful simplicity that has provided for an expansive rhetorical purpose that continues to animate fundamental and expansive ideas of governance. “All men are created equal” is an important revolutionary and aspirational ideal. The impact of such an expansive simplicity informs much. How Americans understand the “rule of law” as an objective and equalizing idea, for example, is directly related to that phrase. But, you really need to squint or close your eyes to actually believe in the reality of that equality. Therefore, the same historical contradictions that created an important rhetorical simplicity have also resulted in a narrowing of who is included in any construction of “the people.” What it comes down to, in many ways, is who has access to the levers of power and who doesn’t?</p>\n<p>That is a question that matters for what I see as “practical governance” or “good governance.” Therefore, we clearly see that any government, enshrining as it does “public” opinion and calling as it does on a defined “public,” can be expansive or exceedingly narrow depending on the definition of who is included and who government serves, which necessarily shapes governance.</p>\n<p>As I try to point out in my book, we can see that fundamental American divergence between exclusion and expansive ideas of inclusion during the revolutionary war. During that war, who was actually included in any definition of “the public” and who had the basic benefits of government fundamentally deviated from expansive ideals. Revolutionaries constantly referenced “the people” and “the public” when making critical decisions about governance that expanded the reach and remit of activist states, but the governments’ treatment of the disaffected, neutrals, or those who outwardly remained loyal to the British government clearly highlights limited possibilities, showcasing the coercive side of republican governance, a side that did not simply disappear with the end of the revolutionary war. Efforts to secure the boundaries of the states that forcibly displaced Native peoples, or efforts to regulate labor (particularly slavery) well into the nineteenth century if not beyond, drew on a clear effort to delineate the contours of belonging and who can and cannot receive the benefits of government.  </p>\n<p>If we understand that past, we are in a better position to grapple with something as simple as the term “Law and Order,” which has made its way back into our political lexicon.  Although some modern uses of the term devolve into simplistic dichotomies of anarchy or law, often rooted in racial othering, I think, obviously, that simplicity is something Americans should and are resisting for a more satisfying understanding of the term which sees law as the cornerstone of liberty for <em>all</em> people- A basic premise that informs any definition of the “rule of law,” which is central to “law and order.”</p>\n<p>I feel compelled to state that I see and continue to see the modern use of the term “law and order” as fabricating a political divide, even despite its uses by Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, and Richard Nixon in the 1960s and then Donald Trump over <em>forty years</em> later. If we look back to the revolutionary period, never mind the 1960s, debate over that term was never about a dedication or not to law or order, especially in relationship to the government’s place in preserving the social obligations inherent in a community of people. Afterall, liberty and government were intertwined for revolutionaries- the one couldn’t exist without the other. Government, according to revolutionaries was “the choicest blessing Heaven ever has bestowed on the human race,” rather than a “necessary evil.” In short, nobody said- then as now- “give me anarchy.”  </p>\n<p>On the ground in the revolutionary era, the people who resisted government using violence or peaceful protest did not mobilize for “no government” or some kind of statelessness, although their opponents certainly painted them as such.  We can see that destructive brushstroke when Massachusetts’ colonial governor, Francis Bernard, glibly stated that the cries of protestors for “Liberty and Property” during the Stamp Act riots in Boston were just a ruse by the “meaner sorts” to loot and destroy property. Yet, he also understood that the riots were more than that, they were, he conceded, dedicated to a “general leveling &#x26; taking away the distinction of rich and poor.”  The riots evinced a growing feeling that “necessity will soon oblige and justify an insurrection of the poor against the rich, those who want the necessities of life against those who have them.” Government officials and government policy during the colonial period certainly made that feeling more real. Such popular actions, even as a royal governor saw them, then, were not about “Law and Order” in the modern evisceration of the term, but rather expressive of a growing sense that law and order as a theoretical assumption only works when broadly accessible and equitable.  Like that colonial governor, Benjamin Franklin, a prominent politician in colonial Pennsylvania, saw the writing on the wall in the 1760s when he castigated that “wretched Rabble” who believed “themselves intitled to a vote.” A vote, moreover, that would allow people to direct the governance of their colonies and then, through American Independence, their states. These mobilizations were not movements against government, but for government. They were efforts to achieve the realization of a government with a far more encompassing, if still limited, vision of “the people” that serve in it and that it represents.   </p>\n<p>With all of that said, we often look to the Declaration of Independence as generating a vision of equality Americans continue to fight for, but that impulse was not divorced from these earlier moments of resistance over governance. It is too easy to see the exclusive nature of that resistance and use it as a justification for its continuance. Modern “three percenters” should give us pause and make us question that line of thought. Instead, we should see the generative side of resistance, its place in the development of American conceptions of the proper role, reach, and representativeness of government. It was and is fundamental to the continuance of a fight for basic human equality. Our modern political debate is steeped in this past. Let me be frank, there was <em>no</em> established settlement on these issues in the revolutionary era. The history of what came after the “founding” clearly proves that point and shatters its immutability, a significant fact we should all recognize and appreciate as each day passes.  If history says anything, it is that resistance, emanating from a body of sovereign people, has immense potential to initiate necessary change. We therefore need to recognize that American colonists cum citizens who rioted against and questioned fundamental aspects of governance were not against “law and order.” Instead, they were part of a fundamental and ongoing debate over the methods to achieve it, who had a place in making decisions, and what that would mean for “the people” and how a government governs.</p>\n<p> If we look to that past, we can clearly understand that when there is representative imbalance or inequality we should expect resistance. I don’t see what is more American than such a resistance if we really want to lionize the founding. And that belief is not radical, but something colonists cum revolutionaries understood as basic.</p>\n<p>In some ways, though, we cannot get past the contradictory nature of the founding, how it was at once exclusive and inclusive. It is a conundrum that has muddied popular perceptions, again and again, especially as that past becomes more distant and perhaps more knowable through a shared belief in its uniformity and, well, its simplicity. But the contradictions are everywhere. And those contradictions- the unsettled nature of the revolution- are important, demonstrating clear paths forward.</p>\n<p>The Paxton riots of the 1760s, something every American historian knows about, are a case in point. If we look at the “Paxton Boys,” a group that is important for understanding the context of popular mobilization against Pennsylvania’s colonial government in the 1760s and a group I write about, we see two informative if competing aspects of governance in revolutionary America. That group articulated an exclusive vision of who government serves. They conceptualized “the public” rather narrowly in relationship to race, which highlights fundamental flaws in how early Americans conceptualized government, “law and order,” and basic belonging. But because they did that, we can lose ideas that continue to animate reform efforts. For example, they also articulated a vision of “the public” that was more expansive than the what the colonial government saw in terms of the socioeconomic status of people. For sure, within that expansive idea there was a narrow and racialized categorization of belonging. But when they wrote about the purpose of government we can see ideals that remain central components of American governance, particularly the government’s active place in assuring and securing the public’s safety, prosperity, and welfare. That ideal governance for “the public” is fundamental, which I think we can all agree on, but it is the way they defined the beneficiaries of government that continues to divide and animate Americans.</p>\n<p>Such a moment, then, demonstrates the contradictory nature of the founding- the paths taken and not taken. But, for me, it is the contested nature of the founding that carries through to this day, divorced as it should be from an inevitability or dichotomy. I see the American Revolution as one moment in a series of uncertain moments to achieve the basic elements of a grand principal that should and could represent the complexity and diversity of the American people. After the research for this book, I came to understand more clearly that the struggle against injustice in its many ugly forms is not an effort to create something “new,” but an effort to realize basic rights as articulated in America’s revolutionary moment. The majority of revolutionaries may not have meant what they said for all people, but, for many of Americans, the fact that it was said in such an encompassing way and that it was unsettled and contradictory only pushes them to achieve it.</p>\n<p>I think that is an important point as we navigate our current political landscape. The use of term ‘patriotism,’ for example, has been consistently transmogrified by a failure to grasp that point, which, as an American, is irritating. Americans hear a lot about patriotism in a way that undermines the continued fight for basic rights, but, if we look to our past, the question remains, what is more patriotic than that fight?      </p>\n<p>In sum, I would answer your question by stating that if we have public interest at heart, we must understand the basic premise, as Pennsylvania’s revolutionaries articulated, that government is “instituted for the common benefit, protection and security of the people, nation or community; and not for the particular emolument or advantage of any single man, family, or set of men, who are a part only of that community.” That may have been a radical sentiment in 1776, and one not many live(d) up to, but now it should be basic. Do we have equal access and treatment before the law? Is the government acting on behalf of the public or a “particular class or set of men”? Does it seek inclusion in its policies or exclusion? We should answer these questions with basic empathy and with an understanding of historical context. If we do that, it should be clear that government should act without partiality and without injustice, anything less is ineffective.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What Makes Good Government?

History shows us that in the past we praised and blamed a development that few bothered to understand and define. Consequences of this could be disastrous. Relying on globalization’s vague abstractions helped statemen conduct policy based on a lethal combination of cynicism and naivete, and go on to make catastrophic mistakes.</p>\n<p>Globalization has a long history. Back during the American Civil War, Confederate leaders believed globalization would confirm the wisdom of their bid for independence. They believed globalization had made them the indispensable nation for the world economy. Secessionists would not have dared to break up the United States otherwise. The Confederacy joined a number of powers in history, whether in positions of weakness or strength, which considered that other countries would respond to trade deals. Their statesmen consider that other nations are venal, while theirs’s was virtuous. They are passionate believers in the civilizing aspects of commerce. Above all, that trade trumps human rights, and in the Confederates’ case, this provided an antidote to the poison with which slavery infected, as they well knew, their international relations.</p>\n<p>Confederates possessed a very selective view of globalization’s benefits and costs. In the 1850s, as part of the United States, southern slaveholders had avoided the worst of the international economic panic of 1858, moreover, the massive immigration flows of the period also by-passed the South. Slaveholders conceived that globalization was just about the opening of world markets facilitated by a communications revolution, the widespread adoption of technology – railroads, steam powered ships, steam printing press, the telegraph-- that made people giddy with excitement that the world was becoming smaller and time itself was passing by faster and faster.</p>\n<p>Statistics delighted the slaveholder: the prices of cotton and enslaved people rose and cotton production soared. All of this data selectively pulled from various sources, proved to Confederates’ satisfaction that not only was the North of the United States already dependent on the southern production of commodities, in turn reliant on slavery, but so was the rest of the industrializing world. Moreover, this situation was just the beginning of a promising trend: in time, textile manufacturing would spread from western Europe and New England to factories in China and other potential markets. Meanwhile slavery under Confederate stewardship would expand into mining, lumber and other resource-extractive enterprises. A world vision that suited them, one where countries would not seek economic independence but interdependence, a triumph of the abstract theory of comparative advantage in political economy, the binding together of nations with their foremost international customers and suppliers.</p>\n<p>This selective, materialist belief that the forces of globalization were working in Confederates’ favor, would serve to safeguard slavery in the future. Confederates believed that the nations of the world, with the United States, Britain, and France, at the head of the queue, were eager to negotiate commercial pacts with the slave power. The direct relationship of customer and supplier (removing middlemen in New York and Boston) would lead to acceptance of slavery. Confederates made the not uncommon mistake of assuming that while they alone had a purpose in the world of virtue and improvement (exports of cotton to clothe the people of the world would spread ‘civilization’ abroad while they also expected to ‘develop’ the tropics with the expansion of slavery). Meanwhile, European countries were prepared to sacrifice all morality, even gamble on the possibility of a war with the United States, in order to get hold of cheap cotton; in any event, Confederates persuaded themselves, the Europeans might not be risking much, as the silent majority in the North would soon vote with their wallets to end the Civil War.</p>\n<p>What lessons do these miscalculations offer todays would be diplomats and trade negotiators? That national sentiment and morality overrides international self-interest. In Britain, empire triumphed over free trade as colonials and millowners stepped up efforts to develop cotton production in India rather than continue to be dependent on southern cotton. The government in London was prepared to put up with mass unemployment and underemployment in Lancashire instead of being seen to be succumbing to blackmail or conducting foreign policy for barefaced economic reasons.</p>\n<p>As for the United States in the Civil War, the abstractions of globalization vanished before saving the Union—with its promise, however imperfect--but in the mid nineteenth century truly revolutionary--, of democracy, equality, and ending slavery. The message now is that by understanding how Confederates got so carried away by globalization, it would be equally absurd to blame it for our present woes.</p>\n<p>Adrian Brettle is lecturer in history at Arizona State University.

Instead we are home, navigating ways to keep ourselves and our families safe and happy during a global pandemic.</p>\n<p>These disruptions to normal life have provided time for reflection. For historians, that reflection has resulted in a consistent effort to identify echoes of the past in our own times. Unfortunately, we have a lot to work with.</p>\n<p>For me, the struggle to finish <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5457\">my book on the American Revolution</a> and the creation of states collided with current experiences to reveal echoes from the past. I see more clearly than ever how individual states and the way they govern shape our daily lives, which is at the heart of my new book.</p>\n<p>Our experiences for the last several months, while similar in many respects, have also been quite different depending on where we live, especially in the United States. While the Federal Government struggles to put together coherent national plans, we have become quickly attuned to the importance of our individual states and the way they govern for our safety and welfare.</p>\n<p>In states like New York, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, decisive action helped “flatten the curve.”  As researchers at Harvard, Northeastern, and Rutgers discovered in a <a href=\"http://www.kateto.net/COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%20April%202020.pdf\">national survey</a> in April, such decisive action led many Americans to see the state governments in a more flattering light than the U.S. Government.</p>\n<p>Yet while some state executives seek contracts for PPE, work with foreign states to acquire tests, mandate masks, issue stay at home orders, and regulate social distancing, governors elsewhere continue to act cavalierly. For example, these personal governance styles can be so strong that the  governor of Oklahoma recently contracted Covid-19 and yet <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/15/891432575/oklahoma-governor-tests-positive-for-covid-19\">continues to deny</a> the efficacy of state action.</p>\n<p>Even in these cases, though, states <em>have acted.</em> They have consciously ignored the seriousness of the virus to quickly reopen their economies without clear plans for public health. This has resulted in a serious spike in cases, instigating new executive orders to scale back reopening in some states, and complete disinterest or obstruction in others. The states and the way they govern matter.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the very real political divide in the country, we can all see and feel that the onus of responsibility for the public’s safety has been left to the states. According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/16/larry-hogan-trump-coronavirus/?arc404=true\">opinion piece</a> by Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, \"Trump said it was the states' job.\" So, \"every governor went their own way.\"</p>\n<p>That is not to say the governors did not try to construct their own quasi-national plan. In early February, the governors met together at the Marriot Marquis and consulted with experts such as Anthony Fauci and Robert Redfield.</p>\n<p>That meeting was, to use Hogan's words, \"chilling.\" Perhaps all the more chilling because, as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/16/larry-hogan-trump-coronavirus/?arc404=true\">Hogan</a> put it, \"It was a harrowing warning of an imminent national threat, and we took it seriously — at least most of us did.\" The latter part of that quote is a poignant reminder of just how important state governance is to the health and well-being of Americans.</p>\n<p>We can also see the importance of the states as we contemplate what education will look like this fall. President Trump can tweet threats to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/politics/trump-schools-reopening.html\">withhold federal funding</a> from public schools and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/10/president-donald-trump-threatens-tax-exempt-status-of-universities.html\">reevaluate the tax-exempt status</a> of colleges and universities unless they bend to his will. Secretary of Education <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/07/12/sotu-devos-full.cnn\">Betsy DeVos</a> can declare that schools must reopen without a clear plan to do so safely. Nevertheless, education this fall is ultimately in the hands of the states.</p>\n<p>New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, made this point clear. Responding to federal pressure, Cuomo unequivocally pointed to the sovereign authority of New York State. “School reopenings,” <a href=\"https://www.wxxinews.org/post/cuomo-decision-schools-come-early-august\">Cuomo stated</a> in a press briefing, “are a state decision. Period. That is the law, and that is the way we’re going to proceed.”</p>\n<p>This decentralized response is not a new reality in our federal system, it is just more visible. States have always mattered for our daily lives. Even after the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, states continued to, as <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/?q=%22great%20field%20of%20human%20concern%22&#x26;s=1111311111&#x26;sa=&#x26;r=1&#x26;sr=\">Thomas Jefferson expressed to Congress</a>, control the “principle care of our Persons, our property, and our reputation, constituting the great field of human concerns.” States, in essence, control their internal police.</p>\n<p>The idea of <em>police</em> in early American republican thought was fundamentally linked to the promotion of “the pursuit of happiness.” For revolutionaries across America, that pursuit required institutional intervention through an active and energetic use of regulatory power.[[1]](<a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/2020/07/22/echoes-revolution-why-states-and-how-they-govern-matter#_ftn1)%C2%A0Such\">https://www.upress.virginia.edu/2020/07/22/echoes-revolution-why-states-and-how-they-govern-matter#_ftn1) Such</a> a power, they argued, must be dedicated to preserving the public welfare, which constituted not just a theoretical notion of governance, but crucially informed the actual practice of governing.  </p>\n<p>Government must, revolutionaries pointed out, regulate day-to-day realities no matter how mundane or extraordinary when the public’s safety, health, and welfare is at play. Understanding this aspect of revolutionary thought matters as much today as it did then, especially as we debate what our governments should and could do. It was how revolutionaries understood the basic premise of governance that forged our states, and it should continue to inform how they govern.</p>\n<p>How and why the states came into being and continued to govern the lives of Americans in the early republic and beyond has been the focus of my research. As each day passes, I see more clearly why the answers to my questions matter.</p>\n<p>And the echoes keep coming. Amidst all this suffering and confusion, we are also experiencing a groundswell of voices demanding basic human rights after the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and so many others. Some paint those voices as trying to end “law and order,” essentially reframing the protests as an un-American movement against government. However, it is quite plainly not that.</p>\n<p>Instead it is a push for good governance — a demand for inclusion and equal access and treatment to and before the law. In short, it is a plea for a government that upholds the ENTIRE public’s welfare.</p>\n<p>Such a demand, in many ways, echoes what I found in the 1760s and 1770s, as colonists cum revolutionaries demanded the basic elements of good governance. Though popular belief casts colonial resistance to the British empire as <em>against</em> government, it was, I would argue, a movement <em>for</em> government.</p>\n<p>Our founders on the ground worked in the streets, taverns, and neighborhoods to organize petitioning drives, town meetings, and “extra-legal” committees and conventions. Although they were deemed illegal dangerous mobs by those in power at the time, they — like many modern Americans — wanted <em>more</em> government, not less. And they wanted that government to be easily accessible, equitable, and capable of regulating and protecting the interests and lives of “the Public.”</p>\n<p>Though the definition of “the Public” was exceedingly narrow in the eighteenth century, revolutionaries tried to work out the basic contours of such a government in their state constitutions. In those documents, such as in <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/pa08.asp\">Pennsylvania</a>, revolutionaries stated very clearly that “all government ought to be instituted and supported for the security and protection of the community as such, and to enable the individuals who compose it to enjoy their natural rights, and the other blessings which the Author of existence has bestowed upon man.”</p>\n<p>That government, Pennsylvania’s revolutionaries bluntly <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/pa08.asp\">stated</a>, needed to function “without partiality for, or prejudice against any particular class, sect, or denomination of men whatever.” Government, then, at its core “is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit, protection and security of the people, nation or community; and not for the particular emolument or advantage of any single man, family, or set of men, who are a part only of that community.” Afterall, as the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript\">Declaration of Independence</a> and State constitutions throughout America highlight, “all men are created equal.”</p>\n<p>Such statements speak to an ideal vision of government that Americans have been striving to realize or, sadly, resist since the heady days of 1776. At that time, many thought they could achieve that laudable goal at the state and local level.</p>\n<p>It is because of that local emphasis that the states and how they govern still play an outsized role in American lives. And it is because revolutionaries embraced an ideal of good governance for <em>all</em> that many Americans are still actively fighting for the realization of our revolutionary dreams.</p>\n<p>In sum, as we labor in vain for national plans to heal our country, we <em>also</em> need to look to our states for real leadership and proper governance. The thoughtful implementation of any plan, any design to uphold the public’s welfare depends on them.</p>\n<p>But it also depends on us. Just like the protests, petitions, and movements that fomented a revolution, our words and our actions, if <em>we</em> make them, can shape <em>our</em> future. After all, the state in the American tradition should and could be representative of <em>us</em>.</p>\n<p>Christopher R.

Published by UVA Press as part of the distinguished academic series <em>Studies in Early Modern German History</em> and under Brown University’s Digital Publications Initiative, <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> re-renders Michael Maier’s seventeenth-century multimedia masterpiece as an enhanced and interactive digital scholarly work that allows contemporary readers to hear, see, manipulate, and investigate <em>Atalanta fugiens</em> in ways that were perhaps imagined when it was composed but were simply impossible to realize in full before now.</p>\n<p>Edited by Professor of History Tara Nummedal and Independent Scholar Donna Bilak, <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> brings Maier’s alchemical emblem book to life in digital form. This intriguing and complex text reinterprets Ovid’s legend of Atalanta as an alchemical allegory in a series of fifty emblems, each of which contains text, image, and a musical score for three voices. “We saw an opportunity to bring Maier’s 1618 vision to life in a completely novel way,” said Tara Nummedal. “The interactive digital format allows us to reach multiple audiences at once: not only fellow scholars and students, but also singers, practicing alchemists, and visual artists.”</p>\n<p>Brown is at the vanguard of digital monograph publishing, facilitating the creation and validation of new scholarly forms that demonstrate a range of ways in which the digital environment is necessary for articulating and advancing scholarly argument beyond the capabilities of print. “<em>Furnace and Fugue</em> is a wonderful example of Brown’s Mellon-supported Digital Publications Initiative, which attempts to develop technically diverse and innovative digital publications demonstrating the unique opportunities of digital platforms,” said Dean of the Faculty Kevin McLaughlin, co-principal investigator for the Initiative. “We are delighted to be able to support the outstanding scholarship of Brown faculty by leveraging this opportunity.” With oversight from Digital Scholarship Editor Allison Levy and drawing upon the expertise of the Center for Digital Scholarship, faculty selected for this opportunity are enabled to develop their scholarship in ways that take advantage of emerging digital methods and formats. These pathbreaking scholarly works are then submitted to leading university presses that have corresponding academic interests and the infrastructure for peer review and digital publication. The development of <em>Furnace and Fugue</em> through Brown University’s Digital Publications Initiative was supported by the Andrew W.

Because he kept the diary only for himself, the entries—despite their often exasperating brevity—evidence interests and emotions not revealed in any other source. His candid writings also provide an interesting glimpse into Barbadian aristocratic culture, as the young Washington commented on a plantation society both similar and different from his own. Novel experiences abounded throughout his travels between Virginia and the Caribbean, and his curiosity to explore and observe is front and center. Washington's keeping of a formal ship’s log on the progress of the outbound voyage displayed his fascination with navigation, measurements, and mathematics, all central to his chosen profession of surveying and his later career as a military leader. Learning through reflection and experience became lifelong habits for Washington.</p>\n<p>The diary also captures the impressions and rarely seen emotions of an ambitious young man rising in society, exposed to an exotic landscape, new cultures, sea travel, and the dread of smallpox. Famously reserved and inscrutable as an adult, Washington allowed himself to admit weakness and fear in his youth. Persistent storms and heavy seas on the return voyage to Virginia plagued Washington with seasickness and required the crew to struggle day after day to keep the ship afloat and on course. It is not difficult to sense the fear he felt for his life or to comprehend why he never again took an ocean voyage.

Manring, whose book <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/2502\">Slave in a Box: The Strange Career of Aunt Jemima</a> was published in 1998, writes about his experience researching and writing about the figure of Aunt Jemima. You can read more from Manring in this article published in <em><strong><a href=\"https://apnews.com/afs:Content:9030960288\">The Associated Press</a></strong></em> on 6/19/20.</p>\n<p>About 25 years ago, I predicted that the racially charged joke that advertisers told about a character named Aunt Jemima “has a long time to go before it is over.” That conclusion was eventually published in <em><a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/2502\">Slave in a Box</a></em> in 1998. Now, in June 2020, the parent company of Quaker Oats has announced that after more than 130 years, it is discontinuing the brand name.</p>\n<p>I never would have conceived that it would only take a quarter century to put one of the longest-running and most successful advertising and marketing campaigns to an end. I couldn’t have imagined that a policeman’s killing of a subdued suspect in Minneapolis would set off this chain of events. And I certainly would never have thought that Aunt Jemima’s owners would meekly surrender her rather than sell her to another master.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps I was right; maybe 25 years is a long time. That’s 13 years longer than Tamir Rice (2002-2014) lived before he was slain by police in a Cleveland, Ohio, park. It’s only about eight years more than Travyon Martin (1995-2012) was alive before an oafish, self-appointed neighborhood watchman killed him for no apparent reason. And it’s only a year less than Breonna Taylor (1993-2020) dwelt on Earth before Louisville police barged into her home and shot her dead. I could go on. You get the picture.</p>\n<p>What happened so quickly in 2020? Back in the 1990s, I wrote, “… Aunt Jemima remains a touchstone for social relations in the United States. … it will be important for her to be a black woman only as long as racism and sexism maintain their persuasive appeal among consumers. …  Her historical baggage is exactly what makes her effective.” While I am not declaring that we have now seen the end of racism and sexism in advertising, something is changing in 2020. We are not ceaselessly rowing against the current, into the past.</p>\n<p>Aunt Jemima was always an insult to African-Americans in a broad way and to white women in a very specific one. Her story in the ads explicitly glorified slavery and invited the target consumer to imagine herself in a very different class relationship rooted in the plantations of the antebellum South. That Aunt Jemima was an insult to African-Americans is not a supposition or an opinion, but an historical fact. African-Americans said so in letters to Quaker Oats and in editorials. Now, finally, she has become enough of an embarrassment to white people that her owners are embarrassed, too.</p>\n<p>The events of 2020 demonstrate that the efforts by advertisers in 1989 to break with the past by changing Aunt Jemima’s appearance – getting rid of the head rag, slimming her down, making her a “black working grandmother” – did not rid her of her historical baggage. Her historical baggage was still the value of her brand, not her precise appearance. The Quaker Oats Company finally admitted that in 2020. “While work has been done over the years to update the brand in a manner intended to be appropriate and respectful, we realize those changes are not enough,” the company’s chief marketing officer said in a press release. People told them this in 1989; 30 years seems like a long time to learn this lesson.</p>\n<p>Now her brand, which has been sold and licensed to other companies for millions of dollars over the years, is worth nothing, perhaps is even of negative value. She has been removed from the marketplace (the same day as Uncle Ben), and she can’t be sold again. The old Aunt Jemima ads told elaborate stories about her life and times, augmented with specific, real places and events in American history and masterful, full-color illustrations. But there is no story about the end of her life, at least no fictional one. She hasn’t been freed to become something else; becoming a former slave wasn’t enough to save her three decades ago. She simply will disappear from supermarket shelves. The products that bore her brand will carry some other name, and the maker of those products can only hope that everyone forgets as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>But it is useful in 2020 to remember how we can be manipulated at the expense of others.

One of the most tragic scenes involves Tod Clifton, a smart and charismatic black man who is fatally shot by a white police officer. Other than law enforcement, the narrator is the only person to witness the crime, which leads him to reflect on who controls “reality.” As he says, “the cop would be Clifton’s historian, his judge, his witness, and his executioner.” What makes matters infinitely worse is that the white officer’s subsequent “lies” about the incident will be useful in enabling white people more generally to “keep their power.” When I teach this novel, I consciously and strategically avoid mentioning Black Lives Matter and contemporary cases of police violence against blacks, but secretly I hope that my students will make the logical connections between Clifton and Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, and Laquan McDonald, which they do. Inevitably, this leads to productive and substantive conversations about systemic racism, e.g., how the code of silence, the police control of the “official” narrative, and supervisorial support of the manipulated report make possible and even significantly contribute to the killing of black men in the United States with legal and psychological impunity.</p>\n<p>The ghastly murder of George Floyd has shocked the world because it so clearly exposes the systemic racism that many people refused to acknowledge or see, and it is this growing recognition that is leading to massive protests and even some riots, thus bringing to mind the rampant civil unrest of the 1960s. In response to the racism-generated turmoil of the 1960s, prominent African American intellectuals like Ellison, John Hope Franklin, Adelaide Cromwell Hill, St. Clair Drake, Phyllis Wallace, and others coordinated a weekend meeting in 1969 to formulate political strategies and an intellectual agenda for advancing racial justice in the United States. The belief was that publishing a transcript of the meeting would give educators, activists, and politicians some useful ideas for promoting political inclusion and racial healing. Unfortunately, the group lost funding for the project, so the document (<em>The Haverford Discussions</em>) remained unpublished for more than forty years. When I discovered in 2011 the transcript of the meeting in an archive at Brown University, I realized that I had found something that could not only shed new and considerable light on the past but could also be of real value in the present and future, as it intelligently illuminates the racist ideology underwriting American politics. The document was published in 2013 with a subtitle that expresses the objectives of the contributors: <em>A Black Integrationist Manifesto for Racial Justice</em>.</p>\n<p>Because the participants clawed their way to the highest positions in American society, they had a privileged perspective of the way systemic racism functions in higher education, political organizations, and the legal system. Some of the most useful remarks in the document relate to “liberal whites,” who want to help the black community, but who “are completely confused.” The hearts of many white liberals are in the right place, which is why Ellison believes that they could contribute to the project of black empowerment, racial justice, and cultural healing, but there is a desperate need for informing white liberals about theories of race, African American history, and super-subtle forms of structural racism. One of the real dangers is that passionate political activists, white and/or black, could have the best of intentions but still unwittingly contribute to the degradation and oppression of the black community. It is for this reason that Robert Weaver, former secretary of housing and urban development, made the following cautionary observation during the meeting: if the “tactics” of political activists are based on an uninformed or misinformed foundation (“lousy philosophy”), the end result will be negative and perhaps catastrophic, despite the intentions to the contrary. Needed, therefore, is a solid grounding in race theory and political activism, and <em>The Haverford Discussions</em> provide exceptional insight for securing and promoting racial justice in the current moment.</p>\n<p>To honor George Floyd, we can use his senseless murder to educate the public and thereby advance racial understanding, racial justice, and racial healing. And given the similarities between the 1960s and now, the probing insights and rigorous methods of analysis found in <em><a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/4640\">The Haverford Discussions</a></em> could be an ideal resource. Indeed, unless we have a well-grounded and well–informed approach to the culture’s rampant racism, we are not going to avoid the deaths of future Tod Cliftons, Tamir Rices, Eric Garners, Laquan McDonalds, and George Floyds.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Need for African American Studies to Make George Floyd a Visible Man","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"4640","Title":"The Haverford Discussions"}],"date":"2020-06-18"},"fields":{"slug":"/the-need-for-african-american-studies-to-make-george-floyd-a-visible-man"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>The University of Virginia Press is pleased to announce that Charlene M.

I document the letters, meetings, translations, anthologies, and mutual allusions connecting him to black and mixed-race writers around the world (especially Claude McKay, Jacques Roumain, Aimé Césaire, Peter Abrahams, Es’kia Mphahlele, and Paule Marshall). I thereby position Hughes as a world writer and a pivotal figure in the emergence of Caribbean literature as early as the 1920s and in the African literary “boom” of the mid-twentieth century.</p>\n<p>To varying degrees and in varying forms, all these writers consciously followed what I call an “ethos of entanglement”: they sought out cultural exchange at concentric or overlapping scales (the local, the national, the racial or pan-African, and the global) and along different planes (the ancestral and the contemporary). This ethos contained several imperatives: “to recognize and accept a generalized condition of interconnection; to cultivate and organize the circuits of cultural dissemination and exchange; and to exploit its motility and flexibility, all in such a way that entanglement ceases to be a passive condition of history and becomes the conductive fabric out of which black solidarity and identity might be sewn” (7).</p>\n<p>In their efforts to establish interconnecting networks across the black world and to develop a shared “aesthetics of pan-African entanglement,” Hughes and his network of writers took advantage of ever-accelerating developments in communications and travel technologies throughout the twentieth century. Telegraphs, telephones, radio and television, and airmail and commercial flight all combined to enable cultural exchange at a pace previously unimaginable. The increasing affordability of air travel in the late 1950s and 1960s was especially important for allowing arts festivals and literary conferences to grow into transient but crucial spaces of cross-cultural entanglement. Such generative exchanges in turn provided inspiration, source material, and claims to legitimacy for marginalized writers living under or escaping from colonialism and apartheid throughout Africa and the Caribbean.</p>\n<p>In short, the faster Langston Hughes’s world moved, the more effectively he was able to cultivate a community of black artists writing from a common well of themes and tropes. I hope my treatment of those efforts is nuanced and even-handed; I acknowledge, for example, that circuits of cultural exchange involve a large degree of self-commodification and the flattening of cultural particularity in the service of a sometimes-essentializing conception of global blackness.</p>\n<p>I confess, though, to not thinking through, in the naïve Before Time of the 2010s, the extent to which the most fruitful vectors for transnational cultural exchange are also the most effective vectors for the spread of a deadly virus. It is hard not to cringe now, for example, when I re-read my discussion of <a href=\"http://appiah.net/books/cosmopolitanism/\">Kwame Anthony Appiah’s</a> use of contamination metaphors to convey a “counter-ideal” to notions of cultural purity. The coronavirus has made it difficult in the present moment to think of contamination as anything positive or desirable.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Hughes’s first voyage to Africa in 1923-24, as recounted in his first autobiography <em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/212882/the-big-sea-by-langston-hughes-and-arnold-rampersad/\">The Big Sea</a></em>, reads differently when we consider that it happened just a few years after the 1918 influenza pandemic claimed <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html\">at least 50 million lives</a> worldwide. What’s more, in his last two decades he traveled constantly, met dozens of writers at festivals and conferences all over the world, and entertained a non-stop stream of visiting artists and dignitaries at his <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/afam/2008/Langston_Hughes_House.htm\">Harlem brownstone</a>. Such activities were central to his evolving conception of blackness and pan-African identity; they are also precisely the sort of <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/super-spreader-coronavirus/\">“super-spreader events” </a>that might allow a dangerous pathogen to circulate among vulnerable populations worldwide.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, for Langston Hughes, his concentric and flexible vision of cultural entanglement, which privileged the pan-African scale but did not oppose or contrast it to other allegiances or identities, served as a life-saving antidote to an ill he saw as far more dangerous and insidious than any virus: white supremacy and its ethos of violent separation. Hughes saw the contagion of racism—for which Rev. Raphael Warnock recently coined the term <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/03/869053460/lessons-to-learn-from-the-civil-rights-movement-as-protests-rage-in-atlanta-agai\">“COVID 1619</a>”—as fundamentally the same whether it paraded under the banner of apartheid, Jim Crow, or colonialism’s civilizing mission. To inoculate readers against the cultural negation of racism, Hughes and the writers in his sphere constructed a pan-African pantheon of rebels and leaders who became the founding fathers of a black Atlantic imagined community. For example, in his 1931 poem <a href=\"https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/scottsboro-0\">“Scottsboro,”</a> about nine black teenagers falsely accused of rape in Alabama, Hughes lists many black heroes such as Nat Turner and Jean-Jacques Dessalines under the banner of “Fighters for the free.”</p>\n<p>“Scottsboro” was written after eight of the boys had been convicted and sentenced to execution, but before the Supreme Court overturned the convictions and one of the accusers recanted her testimony. This poem and many others Hughes wrote at the time elevate the Scottsboro Boys to a global symbol of oppressed blackness—“Scottsboro” begins and ends with the refrain “8 BLACK BOYS IN A SOUTHERN JAIL. / WORLD, TURN PALE!” Similar impulses drive the global outpouring of protest unleashed by the killing of George Floyd, who became a transnational figure with remarkable speed. His story resonates for example in France, where Floyd’s murder sparked renewed protests against the asphyxiation death of <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-06-08/france-killing-george-floyd-invokes-memory-adama-traor\">Adama Traore</a> in police custody in 2016, and <a href=\"https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/why-americas-protests-resonate-so-deeply-in-brazil/\">in Brazil,</a> where police in Rio de Janeiro alone killed over 1800 people in 2019, 80% of them black.</p>\n<p>Langston Hughes gave us a blueprint for circulating precisely such stories of black suffering and resistance at a global scale, for generating bonds of solidarity around the world, and for staking a claim for black people’s contributions to modernity. The breathtaking pace at which cultural exchange can happen in the Internet age would astonish Hughes, but if he were alive today, he no doubt would quickly learn to use Twitter to further his ethos of pan-African entanglement. That ethos would (and does) resonate today, amounting in effect to an insistence that black lives matter, everywhere.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=300\" title=\"Facebook\"></a><a href=\"https://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=300\" title=\"Twitter\"></a><a href=\"https://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=300\" title=\"Email\"></a><a href=\"https://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=300\" title=\"Google Bookmark\"></a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"On Entanglements and Viruses by Shane Graham","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"5333","Title":"Cultural Entanglements"}],"date":"2020-06-12"},"fields":{"slug":"/on-entanglements-and-viruses-by-shane-graham"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>As <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/books/review/maryse-conde-belle-creole-wondrous-tragic-life-of-ivan-and-ivana.html\">The New York Times Book Review</a></em> writes of Maryse Condé in their review of her newly translated book <em><a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5336\">The Belle Créole,</a></em> \"For the past half century, Condé has been chronicling the black diaspora in novels that are rollicking and scandalous, that examine gender and culture, class and religion, African and Caribbean society.

The book opens in a packed courtroom, the moment after a jury has acquitted Dieudonné Sabrina, our protagonist, of the murder of his lover.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone present, including the jury, knows he has indeed killed the woman. But Loraine, his lover, was a middle-aged bekée — a wealthy white Creole descendant of colonial plantation owners. (The use of Antillean Creole versus 'French-French' is highly politicized on the island, a point made clear in <strong>this skillful translation</strong>.) Dieudonné’s lawyer, rather than deny the facts, has built his defense on manipulating the frustrations of the island’s black majority. He has 'put the whole of society on trial, invoking colonial domination and its trail of evils.'”</p>\n<p>We invited Condé to do a q&#x26;a with her translator for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/books/review/maryse-conde-belle-creole-wondrous-tragic-life-of-ivan-and-ivana.html\">The Belle Créole</a>, Nicole Simek, and we're pleased to offer their conversation below.

You have written works in all sorts of genres—novels, plays, literary criticism, science fiction for children, memoirs… What has writing meant to you, in your life? Have these various modes of writing meant something different to you at different moments in time?</p>\n<p>A: To ask a writer what writing means to her is somewhat strange. For a writer, writing means everything: life, death, love, illness, expectations and disappointments, just to name a few. Since writing means everything to me this explains why I tried throughout my career so many genres as I was looking for the one most suitable for me. I believe the novel for adults suits me fine because of its diversity and complexity.</p>\n<p>Q. What led you to write The Belle Créole? What questions did you want to explore in this novel?</p>\n<p>A: Guadeloupe is an island populated by very different ethnic groups: the Békés or white Creoles, the descendants of African slaves and the Indians. Your origin defines your place in society. I explored in The Belle Creole how difficult it is for a descendant of the African slaves to find his place in a society governed by the color of skin and money and escape the stereotype imposed on him. Dieudonné, the hero of The Belle Creole, is a born loser because of the color of his skin and cannot succeed in such a society. If you allow me, I would like to add a detail, The Belle Creole as a title is a joke. It traditionally refers to the vocabulary used to depict a Caribbean beauty. In the novel it is the opposite of this exotic term.</p>\n<p>Q. Another important question The Belle Créole raises is how we should judge a person’s public and private acts, when the two are in conflict. You discuss similar questions elsewhere, in What is Africa To Me? Fragments of a True-to-Life Autobiography, for example, or in The Wondrous and Tragic Life of Ivan and Ivana.  What role do you see literature playing in shaping ethical judgments? </p>\n<p>A: I belong to a society which does not value written literature. An oral storyteller is better equipped to move the minds of the people, express the contradictions of the community and tell of disappointments and bring about revolt.</p>\n<p>Q. The society of The Belle Créole is one that appears to be disintegrating, in ways that might remind readers today of the destruction wreaked by the COVID-19 pandemic, although the causes for this dysfunction are very different. Is the likeness completely coincidental, or does the current crisis point to problems in social, political, or economic structures that are similar in some respects to the ones you explore in the novel?</p>\n<p>A: I am not Bill Gates and did not think of the virus at that time. But you are free to compare the effects of slavery and colonialism with the impact of a powerful virus. Slavery and colonialism were the negation of religion, language and home.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Q&A with Winner of the New Academy Prize in Literature, Maryse Condé, and translator Nicole Simek","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"5336","Title":"The Belle Créole"},{"jsonId":"3840","Title":"I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem"}],"date":"2020-05-06"},"fields":{"slug":"/q-a-with-winner-of-the-new-academy-prize-in-literature-maryse-condé-and-translator-nicole-simek"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Published this week in UKSG Insights, \"Towards inclusive scholarly publishing: developments in the university press community,\" coauthored by Niccole Leilanionapae‘aina Coggins, UVA Press Editorial, Design, and Production Coordinator and Assistant Project Editor, provides an overview of the ways in which the members of the Association of University Presses are working towards more inclusive practices in scholarly publishing. </p>\n<p>Coggins, along with coauthors Gisela Concepción Fosado of <a href=\"https://www.dukeupress.edu/\">Duke University Press,</a> Christie Henry of <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/\">Princeton University Press,</a> and Gita Manaktala of <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/\">MIT Press,</a> provide an overview of recent steps taken by AUPresses to explore and advance our core value of diversity, with a goal of empowering inclusion, equity and, ultimately, justice. They consider the Mellon Diversity Fellowship Program, the contributions of many dedicated volunteers in the Association’s task forces and committees as well as in press-based working groups, and several \"Toolkits for Equity\" that are currently in development.</p>\n<p>\"Armed with baseline information and critique as well as with continuing vigilance,\" they conclude, \"we as leaders and colleagues can understand the scope of the problem and move to creatively disrupt the individual, structural and organizational barriers to equitable decision-making, power-sharing and community-building.

Standing with others on a hill in Canberra close to her childhood home, Rigby “witness[ed] the wall of smoke surging toward us, turning day to night, with burned and smoldering leaves showering down around us.”  She began to consider the idea of the “natural disaster” and found the term wanting: not only did it perpetuate the schism between nature and culture, but it allowed humans to continue to evade environmental responsibility.</p>\n<p>In response, Rigby produced an unusual and fascinating work that artfully braids literary history, philosophy, and science with environmental narrative in a nuanced exploration of eco-catastrophes, including floods, earthquakes, fiery  conflagrations, cyclones, and (most apposite for the current moment) pestilence. Nowhere else, we can almost guarantee you, will you find Voltaire and Goethe sharing book space with the Army Corps of Engineers. Though highly theorized and punctuated by a variety of close readings, the book is yet immensely readable—and immensely resonant.</p>\n<p>“Despite the proliferation of warnings,” the author writes, “some spoken by scientists, others legible in the earth itself, the prevailing social system, governed in large part by the interests of a turbo-charged variant of global capitalism, remains set on the path of squandering. While continuing to dig up the dead, exhuming and consuming the remains of ancient forests and sea creatures to power our industries and light our cities, this system is now promoting new techniques of assaulting the earth through such desperate measures as the exploitation of coal-seam gas and tar sands…. And, even as the weather gets wilder, maladaptive modes of development, underpinned by the mantra of economic growth and the delusion of mastery, are escalating all manner of risks and amplifying social vulnerability to the only partially predictable, and potentially catastrophic, impacts of climate change.”</p>\n<p>We recommend <em>Dancing with Disaster</em> to your attention.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"In Honor of Earth Day, A Post From Our Senior Acquiring Editor, Architecture and Environment, Boyd Zenner","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"4705","Title":"Dancing with Disaster"}],"date":"2020-04-22"},"fields":{"slug":"/in-honor-of-earth-day-a-post-from-our-senior-acquiring-editor-architecture-and-environment-boyd-zenner"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><em>By Nadine Zimmerli, editor for history and social sciences</em></p>\n<p>Last week was supposed to be my busiest yet since assuming the mantle of editor of history and social sciences here at UVa Press. I had been looking forward to attending my first Virginia Forum, on “Crafting History,” which—I’m given to understand—would have involved an evening presentation on the equally important topic of “Crafting Beer” at one of my favorite Richmond breweries on March 26. Then, the Thursday thereafter, precisely a week later, I was bound for Washington D.C. to set up our booth at the OAH and immerse myself in its rich offerings on this year’s theme of “(In)equalities.” Two conferences in the span of seven days, with a visit to George Mason University thrown in for good measure the Monday in-between—I was set to seize spring in the most intellectually rewarding way possible!</p>\n<p>Now, I’ve two furry office mates who are very interested in the manuscripts I’m reading and offer constant commentary that ranges from Meow to Mrrooww, with the occasional German Miau in the mix (they’re bilingual, just like me), but their conversation pales in comparison to the stimulating chats I was looking forward to having in Richmond and D.C. last week.</p>\n<p>At the Virginia Forum, I was going to attend a session in every time slot and fully immerse myself in the various facets of Virginians and their histories—from women at Jamestown to the state’s suffragettes, from Natives and newcomers during the colonial and founding periods to Indigenous polities and politics today, from the African Americans who endured slavery to the Virginians fighting for Civil Rights—and to meet the teachers, archivists, curators, interpreters, librarians, and professors who study the Old Dominion from all angles across four centuries. UVa Press serves the state of Virginia and all its institutions in it, so I am eager to learn about current book projects that enrich <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/subject/virginia-history-culture\">our offerings</a> on Virginia’s deep history and vibrant and ever-evolving culture.</p>\n<p>And speaking of <em><a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5250\">Virginians and their Histories</a></em>, I was especially looking forward to Brent Tarter’s conversation with John Kneebone, Jennifer Ritterhouse and Elizabeth Varon about his new book, which we’re publishing next month. Since I wasn’t able to share the page proofs at the booth last weekend, I invite you to <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/sites/default/files/blog/Tarter_excerpt.pdf\">browse an excerpt here.</a></p>\n<p>When perusing the Forum’s program, I was not only struck by the wide range of topics but also by the attendees’ innovative methodological approaches. At both the Friday and Saturday lunch sessions, for example, Warren Hofstra, Kevin Hardwick, and their team of collaborators were going to demonstrate their virtual reality project “Re-Debating the Electoral College.” I wouldn’t have minded donning an Oculus Rift to delve into the 1780s!</p>\n<p>Luckily, I might still get the chance later this year, when the Forum is set to gather on its rescheduled weekend of September 17–19. I look forward to meeting and learning from all Virginia historians then, to continuing the Press’s long-standing support of graduate students by sponsoring the Graduate Paper contest, and of course to tasting that craft beer on opening night!</p>\n<p>At the OAH, I’m sure I would have enjoyed a cocktail or mocktail at one of the many receptions as well. Unlike the Forum, I wouldn’t have been able to attend a session in every time slot but split my time between attending select sessions and hanging out at the booth to talk to scholars about <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/sites/default/files/catalogs/spring20.pdf\">our spring publications</a> and our long-standing series in American history, from <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/series/early-american-histories\">Early American Histories</a> and <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/series/jeffersonian-america\">Jeffersonian Americ</a>a to <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/series/nation-divided-studies-civil-war-era\">A Nation Divided: Studies in the Civil War Era</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/series/carter-g-woodson-institute-series\">Carter G. Woodson Institute Series</a>. I was particularly looking forward to inviting attendees to pick up our Press tablet to browse our digital scholarship offerings through <a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/rotunda\">Rotunda</a>, which provides access to a wide variety of primary sources from the founding era through the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>UVa Press is well known for publishing monographs, edited collections, and crossover titles in Early American history and the Civil War era, as well as late 20th and 21st presidential studies, and I’m always happy to meet authors old and new who work in these fields. On the OAH program, I was therefore especially intrigued by the panels sponsored by the Omohundro Institute and SHEAR, respectively, and the various offerings on Native American history. In addition, it is one of my goals to connect American history across the centuries, especially with an eye toward transnational links and influences, since I came of (scholarly) age at the height of the transnational turn and my own research focuses on Americans abroad. So I would have tried to attend panels along the lines of the one on “U.S. Responsibilities at Home and Abroad in the 1970s” or the one on “Black Women in Motion.”</p>\n<p>Most importantly, at the OAH, much like at the Virginia Forum, I was hoping to connect scholars to scholarship, to chat with attendees about their current research projects, to listen to and encourage junior academics, to learn from senior ones, and to discuss the latest trends in various subfields and across the history discipline with all.</p>\n<p>Luckily, modern technology allows me to forge the intellectual connections and have the stimulating conversations that arise organically in these conference settings in a virtual way. (On a side note, the East German kid in me who marveled at the telephone in the early 1990s, when my family finally got its own line, is beyond amazed at email, Zoom, and WhatsApp, trust me!) I encourage all of you who would have stopped by the UVa Press booth to shoot me an <a href=\"mailto:nizimmerli@virginia.edu\">email</a> with questions you may have, to share your conference papers, and to start a conversation. As much as I appreciate my cats’ efforts, their takes on American history across the centuries are not as interesting as any message you send me—I’d love to hear from you and meet you!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Busiest Week That Never Was","type":"news","related_book":[{"jsonId":"5250","Title":"Virginians and Their Histories"}],"date":"2020-04-09"},"fields":{"slug":"/the-busiest-week-that-never-was"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>University of Virginia Press and the University of Virginia Darden School of Business have announced a publishing partnership to launch UVA Darden Business Publishing, an imprint of the University of Virginia Press.
