With vivid colors, shapes, smells, noises and sounds, landscapes, sensations, and even the impression of touch, he revisits the story of a man confronted with years of solitude on a desert island. <i>Crusoe's Footprint</i> is a magnificent pantheistic spectacle in the Terrence Malick tradition—less mysticism, more magical realism.</p>"}],"ISBNs":["9780813949055","9780813949062","9780813949079"],"MainDescription":{"html":"<p>The discovery in <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> of the footprint of a fellow human on an abandoned island is a haunting and iconic moment in world literature. In the hands of Patrick Chamoiseau, one of the most innovative and lauded authors in the French language, this moment of shattered solitude becomes an occasion for Crusoe to reconsider his origins, existence, and humanity and for one of our most acclaimed novelists to craft a powerful meditation on race and history.</p><p>Chamoiseau’s novel contrasts two intertwining narratives—the log entries of a slave ship’s captain and the story of a castaway who awakens on a beach and must rebuild his entire world alone. Chamoiseau creates a new perspective on the Crusoe myth, not only injecting the slave trade and Creole history into this previously ahistorical tale but conceiving an intensely original, freeform prose influenced by Creole cadence. This powerful work by a literary master is available in English for the first time in this eloquent and vivid translation.</p>"},"BioNote":{"html":"<p>Patrick Chamoiseau is author of <i>Texaco,</i> winner of the Prix Goncourt and chosen as a New York Times Notable Book of the Year, and, most recently, <i>Slave Old Man.</i> Jeffrey Landon Allen is an independent scholar and translator.
