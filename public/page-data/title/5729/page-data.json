The essays importantly take us into the lives of Black women, Native American women, White women of all classes, women of different regions, and women on all sides of the conflict. Notably, war meant not only sacrifice and hardship for women, but also violence. The homefront was not as safe a space as we tend to think. Just as women and gender historians have revealed how blurred the lines were between public and private, this volume does the same for battlefield and homefront, military and civilian.</p>"}],"ISBNs":["9780813948270","9780813948287"],"MainDescription":{"html":"<p>America’s War for Independence dramatically affected the speed and nature of broader social, cultural, and political changes including those shaping the place and roles of women in society. Women fought the American Revolution in many ways, in a literal no less than a figurative sense. Whether Loyalist or Patriot, Indigenous or immigrant enslaved or slave-owning, going willingly into battle or responding when war came to their doorsteps, women participated in the conflict in complex and varied ways that reveal the critical distinctions and intersections of race, class, and allegiance that defined the era.</p><p>This collection examines the impact of Revolutionary-era women on the outcomes of the war and its subsequent narrative tradition, from popular perception to academic treatment. The contributors show how women navigated a country at war, directly affected the war’s result, and influenced the foundational historical record left in its wake. Engaging directly with that record, this volume’s authors demonstrate the ways that the Revolution transformed women’s place in America as it offered new opportunities but also imposed new limitations in the brave new world they helped create.</p><p>Contributors:Jacqueline Beatty, York College * Carin Bloom, Historic Charleston Foundation * Todd W.
