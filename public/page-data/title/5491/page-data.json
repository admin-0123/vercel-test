Armed with an archaeologist’s trowel and a historian’s notebook, Philip Levy has retraced Washington’s odyssey – from youthful experiences at Ferry Farm and Barbados, the battlefields of revolution, through nation-making at Philadelphia. Levy’s sharp eye and clear prose introduce readers to places Washington inhabited and where his legacy poses thorny challenges and others where a sign could read: George Washington Triumphed Here.</p>"},{"attribution":"Dell Upton, University of California, Los Angeles","html":"<p>In <i>The Permanent Resident,</i> Philip Levy is concerned with the ways our understanding of who Washington was have been shaped by who we have wanted him to be. It is a complex tale in which scholarly research became entangled with popular mythology, public relations, and even a bit of fraud, in ways that even scholars have had difficulty unraveling. This lively, engagingly written book offers a fresh take on Washington, much of it drawn from the most recent archaeological findings, that will fascinate anyone interested in this most famous of American founders.</p>"}],"ISBNs":["9780813948515","9780813948522"],"MainDescription":{"html":"<p>No figure in American history has generated more public interest or sustained more scholarly research around his various homes and habitations than has George Washington. <i>The Permanent Resident</i> is the first book to bring the principal archaeological sites of Washington's life together under one cover, revealing what they say individually and collectively about Washington’s life and career and how Americans have continued to invest these places with meaning.</p><p>Philip Levy begins with Washington’s birthplace in Westmoreland County, Virginia, then moves to Ferry Farm—site of the mythical cherry tree—before following Washington to Barbados to examine how his only trip outside the continental United States both shaped him and lingered in local memory. The book then profiles the site of Washington’s first military engagement and his nation-making stay in Philadelphia. From archaeological study of Mount Vernon, Levy also derives fascinating insights about how slavery changed and was debated at Washington's famous home. Levy considers the fates of Washington statues and commemorations to understand how they have functioned as objects of veneration—and sometimes vandalism—for more than a century and a half.</p><p>Two hundred years after his death, at the sites of his many abodes, Washington remains an inescapable presence. <i>The Permanent Resident</i> guides us through the places where Washington lived and in which Americans have memorialized him, speaking to issues that have defined and challenged America from his time to our own.</p>"},"BioNote":{"html":"<p>Philip Levy is Professor of History at the University of South Florida and the author of <i>George Washington Written on the Land: Nature, Memory, Myth, and Landscape.</i></p>"},"Series":{"seriesID":"EAH","name":"Early American Histories"},"Subjects":[{"subjectID":"ArchaeologyAnthropology","name":"Archaeology & Anthropology"},{"subjectID":"EarlyRepublic","name":"Early Republic"}]},"file":null,"markdownRemark":null,"newsMD":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"0f60283e-e983-5ca2-a364-59ec9d657818","imageid":"5491.jpg","bid":"5491"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3736229290","3897982121","801366883"],"slicesMap":{}}
