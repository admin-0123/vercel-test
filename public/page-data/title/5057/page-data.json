Kevorkian has produced a rich, lively, readable history that extends and upends our knowledge of this period. This is a very important contribution to the study of music and society in Germany, at a time when the medieval and modern intersected and one can see the old world still functioning and a new one coming into being.</p>"},{"attribution":"James Van Horn Melton, Emory University, Author of The Rise of the Public in Enlightenment Europe","html":"<p>Grounded in solid and extensive archival research, <i>Music and Urban Life in Baroque Germany</i> examines the myriad ways in which music was embedded in the everyday lives of early modern townspeople. From taverns and town halls to churches and guard towers, from weddings and funerals to street fairs and processions, Tanya Kevorkian’s fascinating study shows how music could both connect and divide urban communities. Musicologists and social historians alike will profit from her careful and revealing exploration of musical culture in five German cities</p>"},{"attribution":"Steven D. Zohn, Temple University, Author of Music for a Mixed Taste: Style, Genre, and Meaning in Telemann’s Instrumental Works","html":"<p>Tanya Kevorkian’s meticulous yet readable social history of the urban soundscapes in Augsburg, Erfurt, Leipzig, Munich, and other German towns allows us to imagine what Bach, Telemann, and their contemporaries heard on a daily basis – a sonic tapestry that included not just cantatas in church, instrumental pieces at concerts, and dances in taverns, but also night watchmen’s songs, street vendors’ cries, tower guards’ brass fanfares and hymns, and postal coachmen’s horn calls. Drawing on a wealth of previously overlooked documents, Kevorkian deftly outlines the complexities and conflicts of musicians’ daily lives: the physical rigors faced by tower guards, the often fraught business of weddings, so crucial to the livelihoods of town musicians and their lower-status competitors, and the controversial street-singing of schoolboys, university students, and beggars. Thanks to this stimulating book, we hear baroque Germany in new and deeper ways.</p>"}],"ISBNs":["9780813947013","9780813947020"],"MainDescription":{"html":"<p><i>Music and Urban Life in Baroque Germany</i> offers a new narrative of Baroque music, accessible to non-music specialists, in which Tanya Kevorkian defines the era in terms of social dynamics rather than style and genre development. Towns were crucial sites of music-making. Kevorkian explores how performance was integrated into and indispensable to everyday routines, celebrations such as weddings, and political culture. Training and funding likewise emerged from and were integrated into urban life. Ordinary artisans, students, and musical tower guards as well as powerful city councilors contributed to the production and reception of music. This book illuminates the processes at play in fascinating ways.</p><p>Challenging ideas of \"elite\" and \"popular\" culture, Kevorkian examines five central and southern German towns—Augsburg, Munich, Erfurt, Gotha, and Leipzig—to reconstruct a vibrant urban musical culture held in common by townspeople of all ranks. Outdoor acoustic communication, often hovering between musical and nonmusical sound, was essential to the functioning of these towns. As Kevorkian shows, that sonic communication was linked to the music and musicians heard in homes, taverns, and churches. Early modern urban environments and dynamics produced both the giants of the Baroque era, such as Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Philipp Telemann, and the music that townspeople heard daily. This book offers a significant rediscovery of a rich, unique, and understudied musical culture.</p><p>Received a subvention award from the Margarita M.
