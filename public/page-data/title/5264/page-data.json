I am a fiddle player, and like many people who fell in love with these magical boxes, I spent some time working in luthier shops.

In his latest book, Jeffrey Greene takes the reader into those woodlands and into luthiers’ workshops to show us how the world’s finest instruments not only contribute to great musical art but are prized works of art in themselves.</p><p> <i>Masters of Tonewood</i> describes the \"hidden life\" of stringed instruments, beginning with the unique wood, expertly chosen and sometimes cured for decades, that gives them voices that rivet audiences. Greene takes us to forests in Italy, France, Switzerland, Austria, Romania, Poland, and the Czech Republic. We are introduced to the acoustical and aesthetic properties of the spruce that Stradivari treasured, and the mystery of why just one in a thousand maple trees contains decorative figuring worthy of the highest-quality instruments. Greene visits the greatest traditional centers of this craft, from Spain to the United States. He recounts the ideas and experiences of tonewood millers, luthiers, and musicians and discusses their concerns about environmental issues associated with a tradition dependent on ancient woodlands in a modern world.</p>"},"BioNote":{"html":"<p>Jeffrey Greene is the author of <i>French Spirits: A House, a Village, and a Love Affair with Burgundy</i> and <i>In Pursuit of Wild Edibles: A Forager’s Tour</i> (Virginia).
