Her family letters make up most of the volume, bringing to light Martha Washington’s personality in her own words. As she rose to fame, she began to correspond with such significant figures in American history as Mercy Otis Warren, Abigail Adams, Elizabeth Willing Powel, and the Marquis de Lafayette. Her correspondence paints a picture of social life during the Revolutionary War and the early republic. The dozens of people who sent condolence letters after her husband’s death are a who’s who of key Federalist figures at the turn of the nineteenth century. For periods from which few materials survive, the editors have selected financial papers and third-party documents that bridge the gaps in the correspondence. Although Martha burned all but four of the letters between her and George Washington, the remaining documents tell a fascinating story about the early United States from a unique female perspective. This volume offers readers a more three-dimensional, accurate portrait of Martha Washington and enhances our understanding of women’s contributions to early American history. Aside from correspondence, the Papers of Martha Washington also includes directories of key people and places, timelines, maps, editorial essays, a calendar of financial documents, and appendices documenting everything from the inventory of the contents of Mount Vernon to the division of dower slaves, serving as an invaluable historical tool and a readable introduction to the life of America’s first First Lady.</p>"},"BioNote":{"html":"EMPTY: BioNote"},"Series":null,"Subjects":[{"subjectID":"EarlyRepublic","name":"Early Republic"}]},"file":null,"markdownRemark":null,"newsMD":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"id":"306eb9e8-bada-5437-b6cd-6352d7eb5c01","imageid":"5473.jpg","bid":"5473"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3736229290","3897982121","801366883"],"slicesMap":{}}
