This six-county Tidewater region includes the birthplaces of George Washington, James Madison, James Monroe, and Robert E. Lee. The guide includes a brief history of the region beginning with the exploratory voyages of Captain John Smith up the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers in 1608, and his encounters with various local Native American tribes.</p><p>The 460 historic sites described here range from grand plantations such as Stratford Hall, to the modest early homes of middling planters, to early churches, schools, and courthouses. Most of these sites still exist, but some \"lost\" sites are also included because of their historical significance, and as reminders of the continuing need for active preservation efforts. The book contains 445 photos together with 36 maps showing the location of these historic sites. The general cutoff date for inclusion was the Civil War, but the guide contains descriptions of some later sites as well, including many early African American schools and churches, and important sites involving the steamboat and fishing industries.</p><p>Distributed for Preservation Virginia, Northern Neck Branch</p>"},"BioNote":{"html":"<p>Thomas A.
