This richly illustrated volume walks readers through the unique collections of Rare Book School at the University of Virginia. Founded by MacArthur Fellow Terry Belanger, this international institute brings together leading curators, librarians, book historians, curators, and collectors from around the world to teach and learn about books as physical objects. See through their eyes how the book is made, step by step, from substrate to letterform, from printing to bindingâ€”and how technological innovations, such as the invention of paper or printing with metal type, developed in various societies. This volume will prove instructive for cultural heritage professionals and general booklovers alike.</p><p>Distributed for The Rare Book School at the University of Virginia</p>"},"BioNote":{"html":"<p>Barbara Heritage is the Associate Director &amp; Curator of Collections of Rare Book School at the University of Virginia.
